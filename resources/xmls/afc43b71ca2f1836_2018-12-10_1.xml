    <content type="text">By HealthDay Reporter (HealthDay News) -- For certain women with early stage breast cancer, a newer drug that combines an antibody with chemotherapy may cut the risk of disease recurrence in half, a new trial finds. The study focused on nearly 1,500 women with early stage breast cancer that was HER2-positive -- meaning it carries a protein that promotes cancer growth. About one in every five breast cancers is HER2-positive. All of the women in the new trial had undergone a standard treatment scenario. First, they received traditional chemotherapy and the drug Herceptin (trastuzumab) -- an antibody that targets HER2-positive cancer cells. Then they had surgery to remove any remaining cancer. Often, women find out that the chemo-Herceptin therapy has already wiped out the cancer, explained Dr. Charles Geyer, the lead researcher on the new study. But for many other women, there is still "residual" cancer at the time of surgery. And they have a relatively higher risk of seeing their cancer come back, said Geyer, a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. All of the women in his study fell into that category. Right now, the standard of care is to keep those patients on Herceptin for another year after surgery. Geyer's team wanted to know if women might fare better on a different drug, Kadcyla. Kadcyla is a newer drug that combines Herceptin with a chemotherapy drug called emtansine. In the United States, it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating some women with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Geyer explained the basics of how the drug works: "The chemotherapy is attached to the antibody. The idea is that the antibody will carry the chemo directly into the cells that you want to hit." Geyer and his colleagues reasoned that Kadcyla might be more effective than Herceptin at preventing recurrences in their early stage patients. "It turned out that hypothesis was correct," he said. Of women who received the drug for a year after surgery, 88 percent were alive and cancer-free three years later. That compared with 77 percent of those given Herceptin. "That difference is quite substantial," said Dr. Eric Winer, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Winer, who was not involved in the research, said the findings will probably "change practice in the short term." Kadcyla is not yet approved to treat patients like those in this trial. But doctors are free to use FDA-approved drugs for reasons other than their official indication -- though insurers have to agree to pay. Winer said that with this new evidence, "it's likely" insurers will pay for Kadcyla in cases like these. When it was approved in 2013, the drug's cost was more than $90,000 for a typical course of treatment -- about double the price of Herceptin. Geyer was scheduled to present the findings Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The study was published simultaneously online in the New England Journal of Medicine. The research was funded by Kadcyla maker F. Hoffmann La Roche/Genentech. Geyer is an unpaid member of the company's breast cancer advisory boards. The study involved 1,486 women with early stage cancer who still had tumor tissue left after standard chemotherapy and Herceptin. Following surgery, they were randomly assigned to receive either Kadcyla or Herceptin for about a year. Both drugs are given by infusion, every three weeks. The women were followed for three years after their treatment. At that point, about 12 percent of Kadcyla patients had suffered a recurrence or died, versus 22 percent of Herceptin patients. However, there were more side effects with Kadcyla, Geyer said. They included a drop in blood platelets -- cells that help the blood clot -- plus nerve symptoms such as numbness, and elevations in liver enzymes. But the majority, according to Geyer, were at the milder "grade 1 or 2" level. Winer framed the findings within a bigger picture: Over the past two decades, treatment advances -- including Herceptin and similar drugs -- have allowed more and more women with HER2-positive breast cancer to fare well. "This study is another step in the direction of preventing more recurrences," he said. "It's exciting." Geyer agreed. "Women with HER2-positive cancer generally have a very favorable outlook," he said. "The group having recurrences is getting smaller and smaller."

Question: What are the key strategies for DSOs and dental groups looking to expand their networks? 

Fred Ward: A variety of approaches to expansion have proven effective for several successful DSOs. The key is to be clear on your approach and galvanize organizational resources to execute. Some groups took an approach to expand only by building de novos, others through acquisitions of private practices, and others, like Marquee, do both. The main thing is to know what you are solving for. What type of practice do you build or acquire? Where do you expand? Are you in primary markets, secondary or tertiary markets, urban, suburban and/or rural? What will be the size of the practice and so on? Acquisitions tend to be more capital intensive but provide more immediate cash returns than de novos. 

Q: In the next 10 years, what is the biggest change dentistry will experience? 

FW: We all know healthcare in the U.S. is changing rapidly. Dentistry is no exception. My opinion is that several big changes are forthcoming. Most often, I think about changes that benefit patients and/or providers. Here are three key trends: 

1. Implants â The emergence of dental implants will become even more of a mainstream solution for patients who have permanently lost teeth. Dentures are a great solution for many, but implants can be forever, and patients who have them do not face the same challenges denture patients face. If your dentist does a bone graft after an extraction, then even years after that extraction, the doctor can place an implant. Dentists can make you better than you have been for years. Your smile and your bite might even be the best theyâve ever been. 

2. Orthodontics â Orthodontics is going through a revolution right now. More general dentists than ever provide orthodontic services using clear retainers. Mail order clear retainers are now available too. Soon, we will begin learning the impact of this revolution on the orthodontic specialty and the prices of orthodontic services. 

3. Value-based care â Healthcare in the U.S. cost $3.5 trillion in 2017. You have heard the statistics that the U.S. spends more per capita on healthcare than other wealthy countries and yet systemic health problems like diabetes, heart disease and high cholesterol are still on the rise. Better oral health can help solve many of these systemic problems. 

Value-based care rewards providers for patient outcomes as opposed to services rendered. Fundamentally, this is the wheelhouse of all dentists. Their job is to prevent disease and restore patients to health. Educating patients about the value of two dental visits per year and the necessity for treating what is diagnosed, as well as the opportunity cost of not doing treatment, becomes an imperative in a value-based system. Giving or getting patients to take home dental products, like better toothbrushes, is just one way the dental field can increase prevention. Patients become more accountable between visits to maintain good oral health. We know that $1 spent on prevention today saves between $8 and $50 in restorative or emergency dental treatment down the road. Marquee Dental gives new patients electric toothbrushes; the type that most dentists and hygienists themselves use because these brushes are superior to manual brushes. 

Standardization and metrics to measure patient health and outcomes will become the norm. Dentists will benefit from driving down costs, so operating efficiencies will be rewarded. DSOs are built on both standardization and operating efficiencies. So, more formalized value-based care is coming. To me, that is why DSOs are the future. 

Q: Will telemedicine push over into dentistry? How will these services help or hinder the field? 

FW: Telemedicine is increasingly being used within the field of dentistry. Examples include registered dental hygienists performing six-point probing, taking x-rays and intraoral photographs, and then uploading this information to a remote dentist who develops a treatment plan. 

I also mentioned that patients can get clear retainers through a mail order arrangement. In this circumstance, for most state dental boards to support, a remote licensed dentist or orthodontist has to approve the case. 

After-hour dental emergencies usually lead to a telemedicine approach. Patients in regular dental care can reach their dentist, describe the pain and together with the dentist determine appropriate next steps. 

The first two examples are not telemedicine per se, but in these cases, a direct physician-patient interface and relationship does not exist. These are all likely cases in which telemedicine will accelerate within dentistry. 

Q: Reimbursement remains an issue among the dental and medical space. What can dentists expect coming down the pipeline? Will changes be made? 

FW: I mentioned value-based care previously. I think that is the future. Dentists will be compensated for outcomes. Standardization of procedures, utilization of standard labs and dental suppliers, increased analytical uses, data driven evaluations and reimbursements for outcomes will be the way. 

Many of the dentists we support at Marquee Dental already render treatment based on the philosophy that a dollar of prevention spent today saves a lot more money down the road. So, I like where we are right now. A focus on prevention gives dentists the high-ground because the goal of prevention is to improve patient overall health through better oral health. Sixty-two percent of American adults over the age of 30 have untreated tooth decay or cavities and nearly 50% have untreated gum disease, so the necessity for regular dental care is unquestionable. The healthcare system, insurers and employers have to work together to get more of these adults into care, restored to health and then on a maintenance program. This will significantly reduce healthcare costs for everyone. 

Q: How is Marquee Dental Partners combating burnout among dentists and staff? 

FW: I have a lot of compassion and respect for dentists. Out of necessity, their work posture is not good. They work with sharp instruments around soft tissue in an environment filled with saliva and blood. They do amazing things despite all of that. 

We do a few things in an effort to create a work environment that makes each day more enjoyable than functional. We recognize our dentists regularly. The staff in our support center have personal awards they give to people in the practices we support as a way to express gratitude. Physicians and staff seem to appreciate being recognized in front of their coworkers and sometimes even patients. Secondly, we confirm in front of patients how incredibly talented Marquee Dental dentists are. We have a couple of special patient events each year. On those days, we empty out the support center and each of us visits offices taking photos, bringing food and sharing in the joy of the event. So, on the one hand, we try making each day more enjoyable, and on the other, we readily express our gratitude to dentists and staff for the work they do. 

Regarding burnout, we have regular dinner meetings and events with subsets of dentists, our board and private equity sponsors. We listen. We respond. Though these aren't way to avoid burnout, these are examples of the many ways we are present and available, all of us, to hear physicians' concerns. 

We do not push dentists to work additional days. If they want a four-day work week, then we support that. We do feel the calling to provide greater patient access to care, so we recruit second physicians for many practices. In this way, we do not burn out either physician in the practice. My personal mission is to preserve the great dentists we support today, not to do things that may contribute to burnout. Having more physicians seems to help this issue. It allows each dentist to work the days that best fit his/her life, and also gives patients more options on hours and days.

    <content type="text">You're probably not seeing this in your own health care costs, though. Thereâs good news in the latest official government report on national health care spending. That will be a surprise to most people who actually use the American health care system.

Last year, the rate of growth in the total amount of money U.S. residents, businesses and governments spent on health care was just 3.9 percent, the lowest since it was 3 percent in 2013. America spent $3.5 trillion on health care in 2017, according to a report by the independent Office of the Actuary at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that appeared in the journal Health Affairs on Thursday.

Health care spending grew more slowly than the economy last year, too, for the first time since 2013, when economic growth also outpaced expenditures on health care. Because of this, the share of the entire economy devoted to health care was 17.9 percent, slightly less than in 2016. 

For decades before the late 2000s, health care became an increasingly large portion of the gross domestic product, a trend that many saw as inexorable. Rising health care spending threatened the stability and sustainability of government health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid. It also resulted in a de facto decrease in household income as employers â which are the biggest source of health coverage â allocated more and more money to health benefits and less and less to wages.

So the good news is that the health care spending problem has been correcting itself, in a way. The data from last year shows that the major funders of health care â federal and state governments and employers â all enjoyed the benefits of slower spending growth.

The bad news is that patients donât seem to be seeing whatever advantages this brings. Health insurance premiums continue to rise, especially for those who donât get coverage from employers and must buy it themselves, either from a health insurance exchange or directly from an insurance provider. Prescription drugs make up a fairly small portion of total health care spending, but prices have continued to rise over the years. And with more and more people enrolled in health insurance policies with deductibles in the thousands of dollars a year, patients who have coverage are paying more of the costs for their medicines and treatments than before.

So the good news is that the health care spending problem has been correcting itself, in a way. ... The bad news is that patients donât seem to be seeing whatever advantages this brings. The tide on overall spending began to turn during the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009 and the years of sluggish recovery that followed, when spending growth slowed. There was nothing unusual about this. Health care spending tends to dip when more people are unemployed and uninsured, and those who remain employed either have less money to devote to health care or are more cautious with their spending when they fear they, too, might become jobless. It also was predictable that the rate of growth in health care spending continued to be lower than in decades past in the first few years after the recessions.

The enactment of the Affordable Care Act occurred during this period, specifically in March 2010. In the years that followed, that law used federal money to expand health coverage through subsidized private health insurance and expanded Medicaid eligibility. That new money being pumped into the system increased the rate of growth, as expected. But the law also included cost-containment provisions, especially significant reductions in how much Medicare pays for hospital care and other medical services, that provided a counter-effect.

In fact, the United States is spending on health care than predicted before the Affordable Care Act became law.

Experts then and now never arrived at a consensus for why double-digit annual percentage increases in national health care spending abated. Everyone agrees that economic downturns and slow recoveries led to less growth in health care spending. 

What still isnât clear is why that trend continued amid the largest increase in health coverage since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 coupled with an improving economy and a plummeting unemployment rate.

The rate of growth in health care spending ticked back up in 2014 and 2015 as federal dollars flowed out to expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act. This followed several years of historically low increases in spending.

But the trend reversed itself in 2016 and continued last year, with the rate of increase dropping back down to less than 5 percent, where it had been in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

The actuaries attribute their 2017 findings to many factors, including things like smaller increases in prescription drug prices, mainly related to brand-name drugs facing new generic competition and to fewer extraordinarily high-priced medicines coming to market. The report also notes a decrease in prescriptions for painkillers, which coincides with a nationwide effort to curb the opioid addiction epidemic.

The biggest factor in the return to a low rate of increase in overall spending appears to be slower growth in the amount of health care products and services people consumed, even as prices for health care goods and services grew faster last year than in 2</content>

    <content type="text">WASHINGTONâThe same dayÂ John OâBrien was appointed Â as the next senior adviser to the Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary for drug pricing reform, he published a blog post Â targeting conservative groups opposed to the administrationâs attempts to rein in high drug prices by pegging them to other countries. 
 
On Dec. 6, the American Conservative Union (ACU) took out aÂ  full-page ad Â in The Washington Times, warning the Trump administrationâs plan to peg drug prices for seniors to those of over a dozen countries, will force Americans âto accept government price controls for live saving drugs based on deeply manipulated prices from Greece, Finland, France, and other socialist nations.â 
 
â[This] is directly out of the Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton playbook,â the ACU said in the ad. âAdopting price controls from European countries that restrict access to care is not a market-based solution.â 
 An advertisement in the Dec. 6, 2018 edition of The Washington Times newspaper in Washington, on Dec. 6 2018. (Samira Bouaou/The Epoch Times)  
The ad was targeting the administrationâs proposed International Pricing Index that would peg what the Medicare Part B program pays for drugs to prices in 16 other countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. 
 
The United States pays 80 percent more than other countries for a standard basket of 27 drugs, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services said in a recent report . At the end of the proposalâs five-year test phase, HHS predicts drug prices for Medicare Part B will decrease byÂ  26 percent . 
 
OâBrien says that Medicare Part B, which mainly covers drugs administered in a physicianâs office, currently accepts the drug industryâs pricing based on an average sales price of what other Americans pay, which âenables and subsidizes socialist governments and their artificially low price fixing regimes.â 
 
Instead of letting drug companies raise prices on Americans, drug companies should negotiate better prices in other countries or walk away if they donât get the deal they want, he says. 
 
âOr, they could continue giving cheaper prices to countries overseas and take a cut in their drugsâ reimbursement from Medicare.â 
 An advertisement in the Dec. 6, 2018 edition of The Washington Times newspaper in Washington, on Dec. 6 2018. (Samira Bouaou/The Epoch Times)  
Because Medicare comprises such a large part of the U.S. market, he believes drug companies will opt to play by Medicareâs new rules. 
 
The International Price Index is still in the proposed rule stage, and HHS will seek comment until Dec. 31, but the administration is already putting its full weight behind it. 
 
HHS Secretary Azar said in an October speech at the Brookings Institution that this was the best way they could think of bringing down prices while respecting free market prices that companies have set. 
 
OâBrien also referred to a Sept. 26 op-ed in Â The Washington Times by the director and president of Americans for Tax Reform that encouraged the administration to âensure that other countries remove their innovation-destroying policiesâ when negotiating free trade agreements. 
 
Another Americans for Tax Reform op-ed in The Hil l that OâBrien seems to be pushing back againstÂ says the administration is âsurrenderingâÂ to âsocialist style price controlsâ that would âsuppress the development of the next generation of cures.â 
 
âLet us remember that the best way to support future pharmaceutical innovation is to build a sustainable market-based system for pricing prescription drugs,â OâBrien said. âThe possible savings American patients would receive over five years represents less than 1 percent of pharmaceutical R&amp;D spending during that time.â 
 
âThe pharmaceutical industry has offered no evidence of that amount having a meaningful impact on innovation,â he added. 
 
OâBrien is filling the spot left by Azarâs former senior advisor for drug pricing reform, Dan Best, who was found unresponsive outside a house in Washington on Nov. 1. HisÂ  death was later ruled a suicide . 
 
OâBrien previously served as a regular adviser to the secretary for health reform and drug pricing, as well as the deputy assistant to the secretary for health policy in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. 
 
âJohn OâBrien has already been an integral leader in HHSâs efforts to bring down the high price of prescription drugs,â said Azar. âAs a senior advisor, he will carry forward the legacy of our departed colleague Dan Best and build on the substantial progress that has already been made.â</content>

Transcript of Pelosi Weekly Press Conference Today

Washington, D.C. - Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi held her weekly press conference today in the Capitol Visitor Center. Below are the Leader's remarks:

Leader Pelosi. Good morning. As you know, yesterday the nation observed a day of mourning as we said good bye to President George Herbert Walker Bush. We grieved the loss of a great statesman and leader. President Bush preached the values of duty, sacrifice, commitment, and patriotism, he said that in his speeches.

We took great pride at President George Herbert Walker Bush who served as a Member of the House, that was before I was here, but some of our colleagues that I serve with served with him, and always shared positive views of how he worked with them on the Ways and Means Committee, et cetera. I had the privilege of working with him as a new Member of Congress at the time of the Loma Prieta earthquake. He came to San Francisco with, again, all the compassion and openness to how we could go forward at a very, very sad time. So it's, again, a privilege to work with him, he was a blessing to our country. It's very sad, this, right before we assumed the Majority in January of 2007, in that December preceding we lost President Gerald Ford. They were - they were two great Presidents of the United States, they shared one thing in common - many things - being President of the United States, but also, as I acknowledged in my remarks in that January 2007, President Gerald Ford received the Profile in Courage Award from the Kennedy Library, and so did President George Herbert Walker Bush. A reflection of the impact that they had on our country to act in a way that went beyond politics and was about our values.

It's quite a week. It's a sad week. We also observe the passing of our colleague in Arizona, we'll have a service tomorrow, he died the past week, Ed Pastor. He was the first Latino Congressman elected from Arizona, a trailblazing leader. Our Members looked at him from all over the caucus, across the aisle and across the spectrum of diversity in our caucus. He was always there advocating for people of color, communities of color, and the immigrant community as well as a cardinal on the Appropriations Committee helping to promote our values in that way.

Again, yesterday, I had the green - yesterday, we had an observance of the 6 year anniversary of Newtown. That is this month, it wasn't last night, but the observance here in D.C. was last night. So sad, so many people came who've had their own personal grief from individual losses in their family, one family just in a matter of weeks lost a family member, and also some representatives from the tragedy in Florida.

Patricia and Manny [Oliver] spoke, the father of Joaquin, it was very, very moving. Actually, I met Manny [Oliver], Manuel, in Florida recently, and when I went in to the press event, it was a roundtable discussion, but the press was present, he had orange hair. So, when we went in, after we went around and people spoke, he said, 'I want to explain to you why I have orange hair, because I thought when I walked in you thought that that was strange.' I said, 'Me, I'm from San Francisco, I don't think orange hair is strange' - but it was orange for the color of gun violence prevention. Green is also one of the colors. But he was there last night with his hair dyed, back again, and I made a commitment that we will pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation soon, and that it will be bipartisan. We're very proud of that.

Again, as we lay President George Herbert Walker Bush to rest, one of my daughters lives in Houston, her family is there, they went - she and her friends went to see him late last night, and she reported back to me this morning that even at 1:30 in the morning when they were leaving, there were still thousands of people in line to see him. That's to say, he was really a sweetheart, really a lovely man.

And one point that I want to make that I think wasn't emphasized enough was his leadership on the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, that transformed our nation, is an example to the world, and making our workplaces, our transportation systems, and our voting booths, and other buildings accessible, while reducing discrimination against people with disabilities. It reaffirmed our fundamental truth that we respect people for what they can do and not judge them for what they cannot, and that applies across the board.

And, again, at the National Cathedral, it was beautiful, it was lovely, and bipartisan, and unifying for our country. So, as we are inspired, once again, by that, as we were by the passing of Senator McCain. We have some unfinished business this week that you may have some questions about. The farm bill, that looks good. As we were leaving the service yesterday, I was pleased to hear what Senator Roberts and Senator Stabenow have to say about that, but we're hoping that that can be passed maybe next week, we'll see.

The #MeToo legislation. Back in February, the House unanimously passed the #MeToo Congress bill. Discussions continue, I think we're finding some common ground, and we would hope that this overdue legislation would be passed before the end of the Congress. We're making some progress there.

VAWA, we're in the middle of another short-term Violence Against Women Act, we should be passing a strong, long-term bill. We'd like to do it this Congress, and this - but if not, we'll have to take it up at the beginning of next year, but we'd rather do it in the Congress in which it was debated and raised in the committee.

As you know, the appropriations bill is the door opener or door closer, or whatever, however - it's dispositive of when we all go home, and that gives it not only a policy urgency, but a scheduling question. We are, you know, supposed to meet with the President this week, but with the death of our President, now President Bush, that meeting, we'll meet with the President next week, as we go forward to negotiate that.

And then just one last thing, as you've seen in the press, the Senate was briefed on the Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Khashoggi matters, we will have that briefing next week. Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the full Congress. Khashoggi, for a limited classified briefing as same as was done in the Senate.

So, here we are and we get ready - it's pretty exciting to have won a minimum of 40 seats, and more to come maybe, one more to come maybe, and it is wonderful that we had the biggest midterm vote in the history of our country, and Democrats winning by more than 10 million votes. Quite remarkable.

Our message was For The People, lower health care costs by reducing the cost of prescription drugs, and as you know, pre-existing conditions, that benefit was an important part of that debate. Lower health care costs. Increase paychecks by building infrastructure of America, and in a green way. And third, to restore integrity in government, starting with the important H.R. 1. Some of you were here last week when John Sarbanes, with a number of the freshmen, presented that legislation.

Just to update you on that, we may be moving, separating the Voting Rights Act out of that so that we can move more quickly with H.R. 1, and the Voting Rights Act, we want to establish an ironclad constitutional record when we pass it, which will be soon, but not as soon as moving the Voting Right - the H.R. 1, with the other ways to reduce the role of money in government and increase the voices of the American people.

Any questions"

* * *

Q: Two questions. There's a report out there that you're considering limiting the terms of Committee chairmen. Is that something that is actively being discussed?

Leader Pelosi. Well, that's a matter before the Caucus. I've always been sympathetic to the concerns that have been expressed by our Members on that subject. Actually, I tried to do that when I became speaker in 2007, but the Caucus did not support that.

But, again, our chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, whom you've heard from here, has received many - much interest in that. And what I've told some of the freshmen class, other Members have asked for that to be considered, so that's a debate for the Caucus to have and we will have that. Whether that happens this year, you know, in the next couple weeks, because the freshmen aren't here and we have to have that discussion with them here, so how do we do that, teleconference or what, or is that just something we take up next year but could apply soon; or they may reject it.

Q: I also wanted to ask, there's a report that you're going to be meeting Lighthizer about the NAFTA 2.0?

Leader Pelosi. [That's a] different question.

Q: What's your message going into that?

Leader Pelosi. As I said before here, Lighthizer has been very open to discussions on the - I said the name was gobbledygook, but the reporter said I said the bill was gobbledygook - and that's when I said NAFTA: the bill formerly known as Prince. This bill - this bill does not have - it has good features to it, but they don't matter at all if you don't have enforcement. So, enforcement in terms of the labor provision, enforcement in terms of the environmental provision. I think he full well understands that, that's our conversation.

Also central to going forward is that Mexico is supposed to pass a bill that would address the wages and working conditions of Mexican workers. We're not there to exploit workers in Mexico or exploit workers in the United States or in Canada. So, again, that passage of the bill is fundamental to our going forward with that, and that hasn't happened yet. But this is nothing new. I've said this again and again. I said it was a work in progress. I hope the answer is - I know it's work, I hope it's progress.

Q: You mentioned the meeting with the President again on appropriations and things.

Leader Pelosi. Uh huh.

Q: There seems to be a push again on the wall. I've heard from a lot of Republicans in the House that they might have trouble moving legislation on the wall. They had two bills that failed this year on the wall. Would you be willing to support some degree of wall funding if you got a permanent bona fide solution on DACA?

Leader Pelosi. No.

Q: Why not?

Leader Pelosi. Well, because they're two different subjects. What we want in this negotiation, I think I can say and it wouldn't be a surprise to anybody, we'd like to just go in, and say, it's December, the time that we've lost now, another week, you know, for a legitimate purpose, but nonetheless, we're getting closer to when this CR expires and hope to extend it for two weeks, and in that two weeks we have to - within that two weeks, I wouldn't even say the out - the latest possible day, but within that two weeks we have before us all of the factors, all of the issues that we need to make a decision.

I think what we can do, that makes sense, is to pass six bills where the members of the Appropriations Committee have come to terms. You heard me say it over and over, left to their own devices, the appropriators can come to a good conclusion, and then have a CR only for Homeland Security as we go forward. And that's pretty much what our position is now

Q: Madam Leader, you mentioned Jamal Khashoggi and the Yemen briefing next week. The Senate right now is working in a bipartisan way on a bill that would cut off U.S. assistance to Saudi and Yemen, would cut off offensive arms sales to Saudi and would sanction up to MBS. House Republicans are not going to move on that. Is that a bill you would want to -

Leader Pelosi. House Republicans are what?

Q: Are not going to move on that in the next month.

Leader Pelosi. No.

Q: But if the Senate moves forward on that and sends the signal, would you want to take up something similar next year?

Leader Pelosi. Well, we do have - they've had their briefing, we'll have ours, and I can answer the question better. But we do have in our own, right now, in a bipartisan way, support for our bill on Yemen, Ro Khanna, and Ranking Member, soon to be Chairman Smith - Adam Smith - are supporting, and I support as well. Also, Jim McGovern, who I mentioned earlier has a bill cutting off arms sales to Saudi Arabia. So there are pieces of that that exist in different legislation, but see after the briefing where we go.

I'm not familiar with the consequence - I thought that they were just condemning the fact that Saudi Arabia and the royal family were involved in the death of Khashoggi.

Q: They're still trying to figure it out.

Leader Pelosi. I don't know if those - I don't think anybody is trying to figure it out, I think we know. I mean, the question is whether we accept, but we'll know more next week.

Q: Just briefly, who's briefing next week?

Leader Pelosi. Excuse me.

Q: Do you know who from the Administration would be conducting briefing?

Leader Pelosi. I was hoping that we would have the Director of the CIA, as well as other leaders in the intelligence community.

Q: Madam Leader, can I ask - you mentioned the #MeToo bill. I'm wondering why has it taken so long if the House and Senate have passed separate bills to get to an agreement, and do you believe that whatever - of the options that are out there - they go far enough so that you guys are utilizing the moment and the political moment that is happening to get as far as you need to make sure Congress is acting appropriately.

Leader Pelosi. Well, if they do not, you know - it if comes to a place where we're pretty far down to road, but not as far as we want to go, we can - that will be for the whole Congress. We can take other action that applies to the House.

Q: But are you - do you know what has taken so long, why has it been so difficult to reach an agreement that the House and Senate can pass?

Leader Pelosi. Well, those bills were quite different. They were quite different. But now there's - they're coming closer together. You know what the bills are. They're quite different. Coming closer together. But the reason we'll be willing to accept something less than we passed is that we then can pass bills ourselves that apply to the House, and I think that would put some pressure on the Senate to do the same.

Q: Madam Leader, can I ask you about what's going on in North Carolina.

Leader Pelosi. Yes.

Q: Are you - do you believe a new election should be called in the 9th District regarding what's come out in that election" If there's not a new election, do you think Mr. Harris should be seated as a House Member" I also want to ask you about the allegations - not allegations, but what Congressman-elect Spano in Florida, he has said that - he has admitted to taking illegal loans in his campaign. Do you believe that that should cast out on whether he should be seated as a new Member?

Leader Pelosi. Well, it's interesting, in North Carolina the authorities - the authoritative body said that they would meet by December 21, it could be tomorrow, but by December 21, to make - to put forth their view of it. What are their options" They could certify the election. They could call for a new election, which would be of the same parties in the general election within 75 days. Or they could just throw the whole thing out and say 'We're starting from scratch.' There are some of the options.

I don't think the option of a recount is a likely one, as we thought it might have been earlier. But anyway, those are the three versions.

The House still retains the right to decide who is seated. That's one of the powers of the House of Representatives that controls who can be seated in the Congress. So this - any Member-elect can object to the seating of the swearing-in of another Member-elect, and we'll see how that goes. As you know, it's not just the Democrats who have a problem with how it went in North Carolina, the Republicans have a problem, too, because it affected their primary election. The fraud that exists there.

So House Admin will have full - House Administration Committee will have full investigative authority to determine the winner of the election. And, again, only if it's impossible to determine who the winner is would we take the extraordinary step of calling for a new election, but that governing body can do so. So we're all in close touch on that, because this is bigger than that one seat.

This is about undermining the integrity of our elections. And what was done there is so remarkable and that that person - those entities got away with that, even to the detriment of the Republicans in the primary. The issue in Florida is one that we're tracking as well. Then to add insult to injury about what the Republicans did in these races, they are now challenging the seating of our Member in Maine, saying that - questioning the process. But, you know, they have ranked voting, which has been voted on twice by the people of Maine as their method of having an election.

And now the Republicans are saying, well - there's even a question as to constitutionality of ranked voting, in their view. But if they had won, of course, there would be no question about the constitutionality of it. So we're operating on three fronts.

Q: Can I ask for a quick follow up?

Q: Madam Leader, I just want to ask about - you said you would accept the CR for DHS.

Leader Pelosi. Yes.

Q: Are you looking for a CR into the early part of the year" Are you looking for a full year?

Leader Pelosi. Oh, a full year, a full year.

Q: So you don't want to have this fight again in January is basically what you're -

Leader Pelosi. No, no, a full year. There's no point in doing that. But even if you have a CR for a full year, it doesn't mean that at some point if you come to another conclusion you can pass a bill, but you have to - you can't do this week - there's too much uncertainty involved.

Q: May I follow up on this question?

Leader Pelosi. Sure.

Q: To follow up on his question very quickly. Some of your - some of the House Democrats are concerned about adding more money for this border fence, and if you guys do a CR, my understanding is that that would approve $1.3 million, at least, for the border fence?

Leader Pelosi. No, not necessarily

Q: Correct" That's what it was last year. So if you extend that again, wouldn't that cause a problem -

Leader Pelosi. No, no, it depends on how you spend the money. It's border security. It's about border security.

Q: But within that, there was money for the fence as well.

Leader Pelosi. Well, you're talking about a fence, you're not talking about a wall now.

Q: But you're okay with that as long as -

Leader Pelosi. No. I'm okay with what our Chairwoman, Lucille Roybal-Allard, she is the person who has fought on these issues her entire stay in Congress, which has been for a couple of decades. We're blessed that she's in the position that she is in. She knows that. We, most of us, speaking for myself, consider the wall immoral, ineffective and expensive, and the President said - he promised - he also promised Mexico would pay for it. So even if they did, it's immoral still, and then they're not going to pay for it. So that isn't how I would interpret a congressional - a continuing resolution.

We can move forward that - we have a responsibility, all of us, to secure our borders, north, south, and coming in by plane on our coasts, three coasts, north, south, and west, and that's responsibility we honor, but we do so by honoring our values as well.</content>
    <summary type="html">ll meet with the President next week, as we go forward to negotiate that.

And then just one last thing, as you've seen in the press, the Senate was briefed on the Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Khashoggi matters, we will have that...</summary>

    <content type="text">The rate of U.S. healthcare spending growth slowed from 2016 to 2017, driven by reduced use and intensity of hospital care, physician services and prescription drugs, according to the new annual report by CMS' Office of the Actuary published in Health Affairs. 
Total spending hit $3.5 trillion, up from $3.4 trillion in 2016. But spending growth dropped to 3.9% last year, down from 4.8% the year before, despite a slight uptick in prices from 1.3% in 2016 to 1.6% in 2017. The share of gross domestic product spent on healthcare in 2017 was 17.9%, compared with 18% in 2016. 

Growth has decelerated from higher rates in 2014 and 2015, when it averaged 5.5%, partly due to the Affordable Care Act coverage expansions. The 2017 growth rate was similar to average annual growth from 2008 to 2013, a period that included the Great Recession and its aftermath. It's much lower than the average annual rate of 7.3% over the 1998-2007 period. 

"This is unquestionably good news and adds to the evidence that we are in a new normal of lower cost growth," said Andy Slavitt, CMS administrator during the Obama administration and now general partner at Town Hall Ventures. "The very slow per capita increases, particularly in Medicaid and Medicare, may provide evidence that the population health management that's taken hold since the Affordable Care Act is working." 

In Medicare, per capita expenditures increased at a modest 1.7% pace in 2017, similar to the 1.6% rate the year before. For traditional Medicare, which accounted for two-thirds of the program's $705.9 billion in spending in 2017, per capita expenditures grew 1.5%, up from 0.9% in 2016. 

Per capita spending for Medicare Advantage plans, excluding the effects of the congressional moratorium on the health insurance tax, rose from 1.7% in 2016 to 3.2% in 2017. 

In Medicaid, per capita growth decelerated to 0.9% last year, down from 1.2% in 2016. While total federal spending on Medicaid slowed sharply last year, from 4.6% to 0.8%, total state and local spending jumped from 3.6% to 6.4%. That was due to states picking up a larger percentage of Medicaid expansion costs, with states assuming 5% of the cost under the ACA. 

"This shows that Medicaid costs are very well-controlled, and should put an end to politically driven talk about how much we need to have block grants and to put up other barriers for people to enroll in Medicaid," Slavitt said. 

The rate of retail prescription drug spendingâwhich made up 10% of total expendituresâslowed to just 0.4% in 2017, down from 2.3% in 2016 and 8.9% in 2015, according to the actuaries' report. That was the slowest rate of growth since 2012. 

The key factors included slower growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed; a continued shift to lower-cost generic products; and slower growth in use of some high-cost drugs such as those used to treat hepatitis C. In particular, 2017 saw a dampened growth rate for pain prescriptions, which could be driven by broad concern about overprescribing contributing to the nation's epidemic of opioid addiction. 

Contrary to widespread belief, the actuaries found that generic drug prices declined, and there were lower price hikes for existing brand-name drugs. 

Payers and consumers, however, remain extremely concerned about the cost of drugs. Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy for the National Business Group on Health, said his organization's members report that specialty pharmacy costs are the top drivers of rising cost trends. 

Hospital spendingâwhich made up 33% of total spendingâgrew faster than the overall healthcare spending rate, up 4.6% in 2017. That still was less than the 5.6% growth rate in 2016. The actuaries said the deceleration reflected a slowdown in the use and intensity of goods and services. Hospital prices increased 1.7%, up slightly from 1.2% in 2016. 

Spending for physician and clinical services, making up 20% of total spending, rose 4.2% in 2017, slowing from 5.6% in 2016 and 6% in 2015. Spending for outpatient care centers outpaced that for physician services. 

Private health insurance spending growth slowed to 4.2% in 2017, following a 6.2% rate the year before. This was partly influenced by a slowdown in enrollment growth, from 0.4% in 2016 to 0.2% in 2017. 

Household spending, including premiums and out-of-pocket costs, also grew at a slower rateâ3.8% in 2017 versus 4.8% in 2016. This was driven mainly by slower growth in out-of-pocket spending, which in turn resulted by slower growth in spending for long-term care, and physician and dental services. 

While the overall reduction in intensity and use of goods and services suggests greater use of more cost-effective outpatient care, the new data raised concerns among some observers about people forgoing needed care because of high-deductible plans and other affordability issues. 

"To the extent that cost reductions are coming from lower utilization because people aren't getting needed care, that would be a bad thing," Slavitt said. "But I suspect a lot of what we're seeing in this report is better care management and more appropriate sites of care." 

Wojcik found the lower spending growth rate in 2017 encouraging, but said there's still a long way to go. 

"3.9% is better than 4.8% and definitely better than the double-digit inflation of the 1990s," he said. "But that's still a faster growth rate than the overall economy and wage growth. So there are still financial sustainability issues."</content>

    <content type="text">Itâs long been said that the greatest wealth is health, but what happens to those who donât have access to either? Providers are working harder than ever to make healthcare more accessible and affordable, while simultaneously navigating a rapidly changing industry. This has led to the emergence of a new health economy, characterized by patient-centric, value-based care.

At Workdayâs annual Healthcare Summit held during Workday Rising, Ben Isgur, who leads PwCâs Health Research Institute (HRI), shared insights into the new health economy. We had the opportunity to talk with Isgur after his keynote to discuss how changes to the industry will impact providers and the impact that technology will have on their success.

What trends are you seeing with consumers and their expectations for healthcare?

With more access to information than ever before, consumers are more conscientious about their healthcare choices. If you look at the new funds flow and the changing reimbursement system, for example, thereâs increasing demand from consumers to obtain more value from their healthcare expenditures since they have more skin in the game. Consumers are often walking away from getting care, foregoing elective care, or seeking alternatives to costly in-patient facilities because they donât think they can afford itâeven if they have health insurance.

At the same time, thereâs more pressure on providers to lower costs and improve accessibility. Nowadays, consumers have several options: they can go to a retail health clinic, urgent care clinic, or telehealth provider. This will have a huge impact on the traditional health system. In fact, when we surveyed physicians last year, a high percentage of them told us that theyâve already changed their operating hoursâextending them or opening up on the weekendâbecause they know they have to be competitive to meet consumer demands.

Are you seeing any other significant shifts in the healthcare industry?

Itâs becoming more important for healthcare organizations to become conveners, partnering closely with other organizations to deliver better care. The convener role used to be something that was nice to have, but today itâs a core competency and it will continue to be. While the scope of the role may vary across organizations, all providers must be able to pull together the relevant private and public players, volunteers, and funding sources to holistically care for patients.

Healthcare is becoming more fragmented as new options for care delivery emerge, and providers, payers, and employers need to come together to connect the dots. This is already happening in different communities across the U.S. Seventy-three percent of provider executives and 50 percent of payer executives surveyed by HRI said their organization has created or is creating partnerships with allies in local communitiesâincluding schools, grocery stores, churches and othersâto address social issues.

Providers need to identify the gaps they have and the organizations theyâll need to work with to fill them, whether itâs a retail health clinic, technology company, rideshare service, or urgent care center. They also need to work with clinics, pharmacies, retailers, and nonprofits to guide clinical and behavioral treatment decisions, using technologies such as remote monitoring tools and cognitive analytical applications that can synthesize vast amounts of information.

The provider of the future is really more of a concept than a physical entity.

Ben Isgur

How does technology impact a healthcare organizationâs ability to deliver better care?

First and foremost, delivering value-based care wonât happen overnight. Itâs going to be a long journey that providers will need to continue to think about. To survive the changes, providers will need to achieve transformative cost savings, which requires new operating models and technologies that allow them to balance the requirements for care delivery and cost containment across multiple reimbursement models.

While itâs not a silver bullet, healthcare providers wonât be able to deliver better care without fully embracing technology. To achieve the best clinical outcomes, they need to standardize care pathways, use qualified clinicians, integrate care and wellness programs, and customize care delivery at the individual levelâall of which technology can help optimize. Healthcare was a little late to the digital party, but successful providers must be able to balance standardized care pathways with tailored care protocols for the individual consumer.

As providers continue to adopt and implement new technologies, theyâll generate valuable data that will lead to more insights and opportunities. Data analytics will help guide decisions for clinical pathways, and predictive analytics will provide clinical and behavioral insights about individual consumers so providers can direct them to the most appropriate care and support programs with the highest chances of success. Of course, these insights can be limited by the type of technologies that organizations are using.

At the operational level, the biggest changes are being driven from outside the traditional healthcare system. Providers are moving away from legacy and proprietary systems that were specifically designed for healthcare to cloud-based technologies that were designed for larger parts of the economy. These technologies are then configured for healthcare and have the ability to quickly adapt to changing needs and integrate data to make it more easily accessible to employees and leaders, with comprehensive dashboards and reporting around finance, supply chain, and HR data.

How should healthcare leaders approach talent management?

As a healthcare leader, part of your job is interpreting the information you have on your workforce and making decisions around it. You have to understand what your employees need to ensure they can keep up with the changes. In the future, weâre going to see a lot more of humans and machines coming together in healthcare to deliver better care.

Technology is rapidly changing the industry, and we canât just rely on medical and nursing schools because training and education doesnât stop after you graduate. With new innovations and treatments constantly emerging, providers need to invest in upskilling their workforce and shift to a more continuous training model.

Just as important is having a real-time understanding of the issues that your employees currently face because the patient experience is very closely tied to the employee experience. Health systems are trying to do better in terms of real-time monitoring of the consumer experience, but I think what goes hand-in-hand with that is the real-time monitoring of the employee experience.At the end of your keynote, you painted a picture of what the provider of the future might look like. Can you elaborate on that vision?

The provider of the future is really more of a concept than a physical entity. Itâs not just about building locations across town, itâs about providing care wherever consumers want itâphysically, virtually, or outside of the traditional hospital setting. Things are moving away from the old model of a very expensive, centralized health system where consumers go to the providers. Consumers may not even consider hospitals to be the health system of the future. Instead, they might think of it as a technology company, a retail health company, a payer, or some combination that we canât even imagine right now.

More and more, consumers are looking for guidance, so the successful health systems of the future are going to be the ones that find ways to guide consumers to the appropriate digital pathways. Thereâs a lot of promise there, but the challenge will be figuring out how a formal health system can interact with new technologies. Consumer-focused digital technology will feel very different than it does now. Weâre seeing a lot of incredible innovations, even around drug delivery and prescribing practices where technology-enabled pills can indicate when someone has taken their medication. Thereâs a lot of really interesting, sophisticated technologies out there that are providing a lot more data and information for clinicians.

    <content type="text">While overall U.S. health care spending growth continued to slow in 2017, home health spending growth held steady with its 2016 rate, according to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). 
 
Health care spending across all sectors grew at a rate of 3.9% in 2017, compared to rates of 4.8% in 2016 and 5.8% in 2015, according to the CMS study. As such, spending rose to $3.5 trillion, or $10,739 per person. 
 
Meanwhile, in 2017, home health spending grew at a rate of 4.3%, the same as the previous year, to $97 billion. In 2015, the home health spending rate was 5.3%. 
 
Slowed total health care spending growth in 2017 can be attributed to a number of factors, according to the study, which will appear in the January 2019 issue of Health Affairs. 
 
Primary reasons include slower growth in spending for hospital care, physician services, clinical services and retail prescription drugs, âwith residual use and intensity of these services contributing substantially to the trend.â 
 
Additionally, slower growth in 2017 for Medicare spending and private health insurance was a factor, but faster Medicare and out-of-pocket spending helped offset it, according to CMS. 
 
âThe rate of growth in 2017 was similar to the increases between 2008 and 2013, which preceded the faster growth experienced during 2014â15 â a period that was marked by insurance coverage expansion and large increases in prescription drug spending,â the study in Health Affairs reads. âSlower growth in health care spending in 2017 was mainly attributable to the use and intensity of goods and services, particularly for hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs.â 
 
The majority of 2017 home health spending can be attributed to Medicare and Medicaid, which together made up 76% of it, according to CMS. 
 
Medicare spending grew 4.2 in 2017 to $705.9 billion, compared with 3.6% in 2016. Meanwhile, Medicare expenditures grew 2.9 percent last year reaching $581.9, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, according to the study.

    <content type="text">Actelion Pharmaceuticals US Inc. will pay $360 million to settle U.S. Department of Justice claims that the company illegally funded a foundation and steered Medicare customers to the foundation, leaving taxpayers to pick up much of the cost as it hiked prices for its pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs.

Arrangements between drug makers and nonprofit foundations, which cover a portion of drug costs, have gained attention over the past couple of years. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), for example, paid nearly $24 million earlier this year to settle a Justice Department case that alleged it had violated the federal False Claims Act by using a foundation as a conduit to cover patient copays for drugs. The foundations are not illegal. In fact, they are key to helping patients cover their part of the cost of increasingly expensive drugs. Congress included co-payment requirements in the federal Medicare insurance program, and foundations have assisted with those payments.

But in some cases, drug makers have made payments to foundations that were designed to coax patients into buying their drugs. In the case of Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, the Justice Department alleged that the company used the nonprofit Caring Voice Coalition to cover the copays of thousands of Medicare patients using the South San Francisco-based company's PAH drugs Tracleer, Ventravis, Veletri and Opsumit.

Federal law prohibits a drug company from offering or paying - directly or indirectly, - money to induce Medicare patients to buy the company's drugs. That includes, the Justice Department said, payments of patients' copay obligations.

Actelion regularly received data from the Caring Voice Coalition detailing how much the Richmond, Va., nonprofit had paid out for patients on Actelion's drugs, and the company used that information to decide how much to give to the foundation, the Justice Department said. Actelion then would confirm with the foundation that its contributions were sufficient to cover the copays for its drugs.

The arrangement encouraged patients to buy Actelion's drugs when the company knew its drug prices could be too high for consumers, the government alleged Thursday.

The foundation warned Actelion against receiving the information, the Justice Department said.

What's more, the government said, Actelion steered PAH patients on Medicare from the company's free drug program, essentially pushing them to the government program that would pay a substantial cost of the drugs.

During the two-year period investigated by the Justice Department, Actelion boosted the price of its main drug for pulmonary arterial hypertension - high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs - by nearly 30 times the rate of overall U.S. inflation, the department said.

"This settlement, like prior settlements concerning similar misconduct, makes clear that the government will hold accountable companies that pay illegal kickbacks," said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice's Civil Division.Â "Pharmaceutical companies cannot increase drug prices while engaging in conduct designed to defeat mechanisms put in place to check such prices and then expect Medicare to pay for the ballooning costs."

The Actelion donations occurred in 2014 and 2015, before Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) bought the company in 2017 in a $30 billion deal that netted Actelion Chairman Jean-Paul Clozel $1.5 billion.

Actelion spokesperson Caroline Pavis said in a statement that the company is "committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in our work to help patients get the medicines they need."

    <content type="text">Drug spending increased 0.4% in 2017, the lowest growth rate since 2012, according to a report from CMSâs Office of the Actuary. Healthcare spending grew at a rate of 3.9% last year, showing a reduction in growth for the second straight year, while GDP growth accelerated to 4.2% from 2.7% in 2016. 

CMS attributed the deceleration in drug spending to slowing growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed, a continued shift to lower-cost generic drugs and slower growth in the volume of some high-cost drugs. Generic drug prices declined and existing brand-name drugs had lower price increases in 2017. 
 
The report found that the slowdown in healthcare spending last year was mostly due to a reduction in use and intensity of hospital care, physician and clinical services, and prescription drugs. Spending for private insurance and Medicaid also slowed in 2017 due to a deceleration in enrollment growth, while Medicare spending was relatively flat. 
 
The report is in line with findings from PBM Express Scripts Holding Co. Inc. (NASDAQ:ESRX), which has also reported a slowdown in per-person drug spending last year. In its 2017 drug trend report, the PBM said that growth rate was 1.5%, the lowest rate increase in 24 years, compared with 3.8% in 2016 (see "Express Scripts Reports Lower Growth Rare in Drug Spending" ).</content>

The  administrationâs plan, released in late October, would establish an  âInternational Pricing Indexâ under which Medicare would pay for certain drugs  based on the prices paid by other countries. HHS Secretary Alex Azar projected  the plan would reduce Medicare payments for the drugs by 30 percent over the  next five years.

    <content type="text">Sometimes you stumble upon a quote which captures healthcare so perfectly.  Thatâs what I felt when I heard this quote from Jonathan Sheldon at Oracle. 
 
The real difficult problems sit at the crossroads of multiple domains â requires you to integrate data from separate domains. 
 
-Jonathan Sheldon, Oracle 
 
While many like to talk about the healthcare market, Iâve always felt that was a false framework.  Thereâs no one healthcare market.  At least not in the US.  The world of healthcare is made up of hundreds of markets that have some overlaps and need to work together, but each market is very different.  The simplest market to see is the ambulatory vs acute care vs post-acute care market.  Each of these markets is so drastically different, that itâs really not useful to think of them as the same market.  The same is true of specialties and even many regions. 
 
The challenge of healthcare is that it spans all of these domains.  And if you want to keep someone healthy and provide them an amazing patient experience, then you have to be able to span all of these different markets. 
 
I guess thatâs why the Jonathan Sheldon quote resonated with me so much.  Healthcare faces a lot of difficult challenges, but one of the most difficult challenges is managing a patientâs care across all of these domains.  All of us that have worked in healthcare have seen this first hand.  Itâs completely different cultures and often very different objectives. 
 
While crossing these domains is one of the most challenging problems in healthcare, it is also some of the most rewarding.

Facing Rising Costs, Business Groups Urge Trump Administration to Accelerate Market-Based Health Care Reforms 
 
DRIVE Health Initiative advocates value-based health care to decrease costs, improve quality and revitalize the economy 
 
Washington, DC Â â A national partnership led by two business organizations representing Fortune 500 companies, the Pacific Business Group on Health and The ERISA Industry Committee, announced today the DRIVE Health Initiative, a campaign to accelerate economic growth by controlling health costs and improving quality through the rapid adoption of value-based health care. DRIVE stands for âDeliver Results, Innovation and Value for Everyone.â The group, which includes some of the largest employers, today sent a letter directly to President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price urging targeted deregulation and market-based purchasing strategies, and offered a policy blueprint with a plan of action grounded in evidence from large employersâ innovations that have improved health care efficiency and effectiveness. 
 
âItâs absolutely critical for the health of Americans and our economy that value-based care is quickly embedded in the health care system,â said David Lansky, President and CEO of the Pacific Business Group on Health. âPolicymakers must focus on what works to achieve these goals, and we know that value- based care helps to drive down costs and improve patient outcomes.â 
 
America spends far more than any other country on health care, but our outcomes are below average compared to other developed countries on many key health care indicators. Health care spending outpaces GDP and inflation growth, sapping Americaâs economic health. This misalignment in spending and outcomes is partially the result of the fee-for-service payment model, which pays solely for the volume of health care services without regard to quality, and is still used in over 80 percent of health care transactions. 
 
Value-based care and market-based strategies â including value-based payment, transparency, consumer engagement, and healthy competition â have the proven potential to incentivize high-quality patient care. This market-based approach builds upon 20 years of innovation in payment, benefit design and consumer engagement by the business community. Value-based care ensures patients receive better care and can make more informed choices, providers are rewarded for achieving quality patient outcomes, purchasers are paying for what works, and businesses can invest in jobs and innovation. 
 
âValue-based care should be front and center when policymakers look for ways to improve quality and make health care more accessible and affordable,â said Annette Guarisco Fildes, President and CEO of The ERISA Industry Committee. âRemember, the government pays for insurance for about 100 million people. In order to cut taxes and fund other national priorities, we've got to drive government efficiency, effectiveness and accountability â and there is no better or more proven way to do that than promoting value-based care, short of curing diseases altogether.â 
 
The Initiativeâs policy blueprint, found on its website www.DRIVEhealth.org , urges immediate targeted deregulation and other actions to break down policy barriers that discourage value-based care innovation and prevent the health care market from delivering valuable products at affordable costs. The Initiative also urges the administration, as the largest single purchaser of health care, to align with private sector purchaser strategies and continue to progress toward value-based care. The blueprint focuses on the following elements: 
  Consumer Engagement and Appropriate Financial Incentives , including smarter use of Health Savings Accounts in High Deductible Health Plans; lower cost-sharing for high-value chronic care management services; and more flexible use of value-based care for Medicare beneficiaries.  Alternative Provider Payment Models , including prospectively-set payments for comprehensive bundles; larger financial incentives for providers accepting two-sided financial risk; strong financial incentives for hospitals to provide high-quality care, including the reduction of avoidable readmissions and hospital-acquired conditions; prospective enrollment in Medicare Accountable Care Organizations; and wider use of telehealth services.  Transparency and Performance Measures , including stronger requirements for standardized measures of clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes and patient experience; creation of aggregated databases that pool data from various sources, including clinical data from providers and hospitals as well as insurance claims data; and stronger interoperability requirements for electronic medical records and patient-generated data.   
About The ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC) 
The ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC) is the only national association that advocates exclusively for large employers on health, retirement and compensation public policies at the state, federal and local levels. ERIC members are the largest companies in the country, leaders in every sector of the economy and innovators in health care design and delivery through providing health coverage to their employees, retirees, and families across the the country.

The group represents more than 60 large health care purchasing members, who provide coverage to nearly ten million individuals in the United States.

Our members scored massive victories in this yearâs midterm elections, AFT President Randi Weingarten declared in a keynote address to state leaders this week at the AFT Legislative/Political Conference. But the real achievements are yet to come. 



Pausing to praise hundreds of members in their third day of a historic charter school strike in Chicago, Weingarten marked the fact that our union finds itself in a place we havenât been in a generationâa place where voters have begun to swing back in favor of public services. 

More Americans voted this year than in any other midterm election in more than a century. Young people, single people and suburbanites stepped up to vote. It took a while for the wave to crest, but AFT members helped flip nearly 40 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, where, for the first time ever, a majority of the majority will be made up of women and people of color. 

Roughly half the 300 AFT members who ran this year won. And the candidates we supported ran on platforms that matched the AFTâs core values: great public schools and colleges for all, good jobs that support a decent life, affordable healthcare, the fight against discrimination and the defense of democracy. 

Now that we have these new leaders in place, we need to get things done, Weingarten said. We have to turn these victories into laws and policies that improve peopleâs lives, like dealing with gun violence and student loan debt. For example, she suggested mandating that every new public employee automatically be enrolled in student loan forgiveness when they start their first job. 

âWe have this moment in time when we can move people,â Weingarten said. âThrough engagement with our members and the community, we as a union can become the vehicle of movement toward a better life. Because if we donât grow and build on what just happened, then we will lose it.â 

Rep. Nancy Pelosi also addressed AFT leaders at the conference and thanked AFT members across the country for showing up for the midterm elections. And she asked members to stay engaged. 



âItâs going to be an interesting time. I want people to think of the House as a national town hall; we want you to tune in on social media.â 

Pelosi celebrated the fact that more women, LGBTQ people, people of color and veterans will enter this Congress than ever before. 

âThis diversity of background will strengthen us,â she said. âNow, we have to channel all this enthusiasm, difference and energy in a way that keeps us focused on our âfor the peopleâ agenda. Diversity is strength, unity is power: Thatâs true for Congress and also for the AFT.â 

In her speech, Pelosi outlined a political agenda that includes lowering the cost of prescription drugs, preserving coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, building infrastructure, reducing the role of dark money in politics, ensuring a vote on the future for Dreamers and requiring commonsense background checks for gun buyers. 

âWe should be building infrastructure, not building walls but building schools,â Pelosi said. âNothing brings more money to the treasury than investing in educationâwhether itâs early childhood education, K-12, college, postgrad, or lifetime learning for workers. Education and job readiness come together in a very important way. And we must do everything we can to enable young people and lifetime learners so people can fulfill those aspirations they have for themselves and their children.â 
For the AFTâs path forward, trust is key 
The key to building a better life for workers is building coalitions and trust, Weingarten said. Itâs what we did in the run-up to the U.S. Supreme Courtâs decision in Janus v. AFSCME . Â Itâs what we did during the school strikes in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona. And itâs what weâre doing in Chicago right now as public charter school educators stand on the picket lines for the first time ever. âItâs people coming together in all these unlikely places,â she said, âto support our values.â 

Since Janus , our members have been sticking with the union. âWe are doing better than I ever, ever could have imagined,â Weingarten said, recalling how, at the AFT convention in July, the highlight for her was when delegates took the microphones and talked about the work they were doing to engage members. âThat is an amazing tribute to every one of our leaders, every one of our activists and members.â 

As we start this new era, the AFT president said, the nationâs climate has changed. Americans are beginning to acknowledge the effects of povertyâand theyâve stopped blaming teachers for it. They also are beginning to reject privatization of public services. 

Weingarten charted a way forward in her speech, saying that AFT leaders and activists across the country must engage our members and communities around our shared values and aspirations. We must prove day in and day out that the union is the vehicle for a better life, a voice at work and a stronger democracy. 

âWe have been through so many existential threats, I canât even name them. We have gone through a lot together,â Weingarten said. âNow we have been granted a moment of transformation that is within our grasp. Now is our moment to seize it, to make a better life for people, because by joining together in our union, we can accomplish things that would be impossible for individuals on their own.â

Government clampdowns or price controls on prescription drugs can produce adverse effects that ultimately harm patients and taxpayers. Fortunately, policymakers have better alternatives. Here are just a few ideas from National Taxpayers Union: 

1) Negotiate and Promulgate Trade Policies that Prioritize Savings . Smart trade policies, in the form of new agreements, enforcing existing agreements, and utilizing dispute forums can be key to ensuring that the intellectual property backing up U.S.-manufactured drugs of all types is protected rather than exploited. 

For several decades , India has pursued a controversial policy of allowing its drug industry to copy patented U.S. drugs in controversial ways. Today, while India produces huge volumes of drugs for export, it is facing new questions about fake drugs and its appropriation of othersâ discoveries. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the âpromise doctrineâ in Canadaâs courts effectively sanctioned the invalidation of some two dozen patents on innovator drugs being sold within that countryâs borders. This approach was taken by lower courts to rule on patentsâ âutilityâ (validity) based on judgments of whether or how well a patent fulfilled its âpromises.â It wasnât until 2017 that the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that this approach was âunsound.â In 2015, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundationâs annual report on the worldâs worst âinnovation mercantilist policiesâ cited Russia for its âsubsidies, price preferences, procurement restrictions, and other policies as part of an explicit import substitution goalâ with pharmaceuticals. These and other countriesâ behavior essentially raise the prices that patients and governments elsewhere must pay to finance the R&amp;D of blockbuster drugs. More U.S. diplomatic and economic pressure can be helpful in mitigating such behavior. 

Three years ago, Congress passed the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act. The new law specifically directed the Executive Branch to pursue trade deals that will: 
Ensure âthat the provisions of any trade agreement governing intellectual property rights that is entered into by the United States reflect a standard of protection similar to that found in United States lawâ; â[A]chieve the elimination of government measures such as price controls and reference pricing which deny full market access for United States productsâ; and â[E]nsure that government regulatory reimbursement regimes are transparent, provide procedural fairness, are nondiscriminatory, and provide full market access for United States products. 
The current U.S. Canada Mexico Agreement on trade is one key test of whether such principles will be fairly and evenly applied, as well as whether it will reflect the balanced U.S. policy toward patented drugs and generics that has tended provide taxpayers with both long-term and intermediate savings on pharmaceuticals dispensed through government programs. This and future trade agreements must pay particular attention to the Trade Priorities and Accountability Actâs guidance. Congress will be debating renewal of this law next year. 

2) Reduce Barriers within the FDA drug approval process. The Food and Drug Administrationâs (FDA) drug approval process was established to ensure only the safest of products enter the market. However, the FDAâs current approach is outdated and fails to meet the needs of a modern and increasingly complex health care system. Lengthy and costly regulations can cause delays to innovative breakthroughs that would enhance public health. It can take over a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars to approve a new drug, with much of that cost stemming from FDA clinical trials. As the clinical trials become a longer process, good drugs become delayed and it is more expensive to produce new drugs. The result is fewer drugs coming to market and that are costlier for consumers to purchase. 

Congress and the administration should engage in a comprehensive overhaul of the FDA to streamline efficiencies and cut down on red tape. Faster approval of safe drugs can increase innovation, and by approving drugs more quickly, it can decrease costs associated with research and development. This will allow research companies to put more resources into developing new life saving medications and restrain drug costs on consumers. 

Some progress has already been made, especially in the area of generic approvals. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottliebâs policy of clearing away the agencyâs backlog of work has led to record numbers of generic drug approvals in Fiscal Year 2017 (at 936). In October 2018, Gottlieb announced that record had been shattered again, rising to 971 for the end of the just-concluded fiscal year. These approvals translate directly into savings for the health care system: roughly $26 billion over the last 20 months, according to the Council of Economic Advisers. 

More can be done. In September 2017 NTU joined with a diverse coalition of organizations asking CMS to clarify its Medicare reimbursement policies so as to clear up a disincentive against utilizing biosimilar drugs, which can offer substantial savings to taxpayers. 

3) Repeal Taxes and Unnecessary Regulations that Raise Medication Costs . Misguided taxes on pharmaceutical producers raise the cost of medication for patients across the system. Â As these taxes increase costs, it becomes more difficult for middle class families to meet their health care and prescription drug needs. Since enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, health care costs have not slowed to the degree originally promised. While supporters of such taxes believe these added costs will only be paid for by corporations, in reality, these costs will be passed on through consumers in the form of higher prices. 

To reduce the cost of prescription drugs, lawmakers should repeal all ACA taxes. Repealing the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, just one of the numerous new taxes included in the ACA would mark important progress. As the Tax Foundation described in a 2015 analysis , this tax âis targeted at pharmaceutical companies that sell branded prescription drugs. Unlike most taxes, the Branded Prescription Drug Fee is calculated not as a percentage of pharmaceutical companyâs total sales, but in proportion to its share of the branded prescription drugs market.â The problem is that this levy can quickly add up as a major burden. According to the study: 

There is significant reason, in theory, to believe that an excise tax such as the Branded Prescription Drug Fee would lead to rising pharmaceutical prices. According to a study from RAND, demand for prescription pharmaceuticals is highly inelastic: sales typically fall by only 0.05-0.08% for each 1% increase in cost. This means that a tax on branded prescription drugs would probably not lead to a large fall in drug sales, but would mostly translate into an increase in drug prices. Because the branded prescription drug industry is about $268 billion in size, a tax of $3 billion on the industry is equivalent to roughly 1% of sales âÂ­ which would lead to a significant portion of the observed rise in prices. 

Public officials must pay greater attention to the artificial -- but palpable -- pressure their revenue-raising policies can exert on consumer-based markets. Indeed, by cutting into the prosperity of our health care sector through short-sighted taxes, they may be adversely impacting the long-term revenue picture for government treasuries, which might otherwise have benefited from healthy corporate profit, property, and other tax receipts. 

4) Have the Private Market Take the Lead to Reduce Drug Costs. As weâve experienced since the enactment of the ACA, additional government involvement in the health care market has not performed as promised. In order for costs to go down, the government needs to take a back seat to foster private sector competition. 

Value-based health care has more potential than any other model for delivering what free-market public policy advocates have long sought: stronger patient-provider relationships, consumers empowered with decision-making over how to deploy resources, limited government interference in the evolution of services, and nimble programs capable of embracing evidence-based results. Ultimately, this approach boils down to paying for individualized drug therapies whose effectiveness is based on measurable outcomes -- prevention of costlier problems and treatments down the line. This will foster an organic fiscal responsibility that is far more durable than complex rules, price controls, or rationing. 

One illustration of such a trend is the recent merger between health insurer Cigna and the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Express Scripts. Cigna CEO David Cordani has set an ambitious goal for his company to achieve across its programs âCPI [consumer price index]-level medical cost inflation by 2021,â with value-based care as a central driver. 

Calculations show that if this goal were applied to Medicare and Medicaid: 

Official federal estimates project that Medicare and Medicaid combined will grow from $1.18 trillion in 2021 to $1.74 trillion in 2026. If, instead, those programs grew only as fast as the governmentâs forecasted rate of general CPI for the same period, outlays would be $1.33 trillion â a much more manageable scenario. 

The principles behind value-based care can also be commendable adapted to individual products. Bayer has developed a Commitment Program for its recently approved cancer therapy drug Vitrakvi, whereby the company will refund the cost of the drug to âpayers, patients and third-party organizations paying on behalf of patients, in the event eligible patients do not experience clinical benefit within 90 days of treatment initiation.â This revolutionary approach could incrementally but powerfully change the way pharmaceuticals compete. 

5) Reform Government Health Programs that Needlessly Raise Prices Across the System. One of the major debates sure to arise in the upcoming Congress will relate to the size and role of government in Americaâs health care system. Some continue to push for expanded federal involvement far beyond the ACA, but such proposals are misguided and will not get to the root of the problem. Before Congress should move forward with a government takeover of the private insurance market, policymakers should explore reforms to the many problems already plaguing government-run programs that are meant to subsidize consumer drug costs. In many cases, these programs are well intended but fail at achieving their goal, and leave taxpayers footing the bill for their shortcomings. 

The 340B program is an instance of well-intended policy that instead appears to be exacerbating higher drug costs. Established in 1992, it requires pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in Medicaid to provide discounted drugs to certain healthcare providers that serve uninsured and low-income patients. Because 340B enables hospitals to purchase outpatient drugs below market value, many hospitals have an incentive to increase their profit by prescribing more expensive drugs without passing along the savings to the safety-net patients. As a result of these lucrative incentives, hospital enrollment in the 340B program has exploded -- up from 7,806 entities in 2013 to 21,554 in 2017, a 176 percent increase. Earlier this year a joint communication to Congress from NTU and Council for Citizens Against Government Waste observed: 

Non-hospital entities, such as federally-qualified health centers, Ryan White HIV/AIDs program grantees, and specialized clinics must operate within the rules of their federal grants and programs, so there is more of a guarantee they will utilize their 340B drug savings required by the law. Â On the other hand, 340B hospitals have no such restriction and can utilize the funds for anything they choose, such as constructing new buildings and other overhead and investment activities.Â  Congress should institute an audit or tracking system for how 340B hospitals utilize their pharmaceutical savings and make sure it is in line with the lawâs intent. 

In addition, NTU has endorsed a bipartisan bill to declare a âtime-outâ on new enrollees to the program while new managerial controls are developed. 

Another example of needed program reform is in the area of âcompoundingâ -- pharmacies that specialize in customized formulations of drugs. While useful for many patients, such pharmacies have also been involved in safety scandals as well as accused of promoting unnecessary medications . Medicareâs Inspector General noted that between 2006 and 2015 Part D experienced a rate of expenditure increase on compounded drugs that was about four times faster than for other medications in the program. Between 2010 and 2015 the Pentagonâs Tricare program had to clamp down on reimbursements for compounded drugs after payments for these items rose from $23 million for an entire year to $550 million in one month . 

6) Enhance Oversight Measures of Government Health Care Programs. If taxpayers are forced to pay for billions of dollars in programs that are meant to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, they deserve to have that money spent in an efficient and cost effective manner. Far too often do we hear stories of agency mismanagement of funds, beneficiaries abusing their position, and individuals trying to game the system. 

Congress should work to achieve real solutions to not only recover misspent money on prescriptions after the fact, but also to detect and prevent such problems before they happen. One place to start is by introducing smart card technology into the government health care system. Utilizing identity and information management techniques developed in the private sector, smart cards can not only reduce fraudulent transactions, they can assist with other costly health problems such as prescription abuse. Twelve citizen groups have endorsed legislation for a smart card pilot program in Medicare. Writing in support of the bill (HR 6690, the Fighting Fraud to Protect Care for Seniors Act), the groups observed: 

Federal health care programs have long been plagued by improper payments, one component of which is attributable to fraudulent activities such as identity theft, billing for services never rendered, or falsifying patient records to obtain prescription drugs illicitly. A 2012 study led by former Director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Donald Berwick pegged the fraud rate alone (as opposed to other types of improper payments) in Medicare and Medicaid at between 3 percent and 10 percent of all dollars spent. In 2016 GAO estimated that smart cards could have impacted roughly one in five of health care fraud cases it examined from 2010 on the federal level. Companies that have experience with developing smart cards provide much higher estimates of this salutary effect. 

Even accepting Berwickâs or GAOâs lower-end calculations, however, it is clear that the federal government could realize reduced fraud costs of several billion dollars annually with an aggressive smart card initiative for Medicare and other federal health programs such as Medicaid and the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program. Instituting a pilot project for this technology, is an appropriate and proper place to begin this transformation. 

HR 6690 passed the House in the 115th Congress, and awaits Senate action in 2018. 

Payment review processes could likewise save taxpayers billions in Medicare and Medicaid if applied more aggressively. Such implementation could occur in several ways through executive or legislative branch action, as NTU and CCAGW recently explained in a November 2018 letter to the Senate Finance Committee: 

In September 2012, CMS launched a prepayment review demonstration project in 11 states with high incidences of improper payments and fraud, as well as four states with high numbers of short hospital stays. Despite being hamstrung by CMS rules that proscribed the RACs from freely pursuing areas of vulnerability in Medicare claims and the fact that it was abruptly truncated one year short of its statutory three-year duration, the RACsâ prepayment demonstration project still recovered a net of $192 million on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. Â â¦ Taxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries have waited patiently for decades for CMS to move away once and for all from the wasteful and inefficient âpay and chaseâ program integrity model. Adding a significant prepayment review program, coupled with the current post-payment review program, is exactly the kind of private-sector best practice CMS is seeking to help prevent tens of billions in losses each year to protect Medicare now and in the future. 

These two recommendations only scratch the surface of steps government can take to more effectively steward the resources it already has for health care and prescription drugs. 

7) Recognize the Balance between Intermediate and Long-Term Cost Savings for Taxpayers. 

In issuing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on certain reimbursements for Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs -- which included linking payments for those drugs to an international pricing index -- the Department of Health and Human Services established a five-year savings target of more than $17 billion for the program. In pursuing such a goal, it is important to remember that short-term savings (assuming they materialize) must be weighed against offsetting costs to taxpayers. 

Price controls have some appeal because in the near future, they appear to deliver lower costs to consumers. Unfortunately, they come with consequences. According to a 2008 Rand Institute study of drug price controls: âIn general, price controls reduced life expectancy over time. The price control scenario simulated the effect of a 20-percent reduction in manufacturer revenue while holding consumers' out-of-pocket prices constant. Price controls would have small negative effects on life expectancy for current cohorts, but more significant negative effects in the future â¦ The results illustrate that imposing price controls would offer a modest benefit to the current generation but pose substantial risks and potentially high costs for later ones.â 

One reason that prescription drug spending historically accounts for a share of total national health expenditures hovering slightly above or below 10 percent annually is because costly innovator pharmaceuticals combine with less expensive generics to keep the overall trend somewhat stable. Â From 2010 to 2014, branded and unbranded generic drugs grew from 77.2 percent to 87.5 percent of all prescriptions dispensed nationwide. That proportion has since risen to 90 percent, for a savings to the total health care system of more than $250 billion annually. Taxpayer-funded programs share in these benefits. 

At the same time, innovative patented medications have a crucial place of their own in a balanced system that delivers longer-run gains for taxpayers. Even high-priced pharmaceuticals tend to be a better long-run bargain because they replace hospital stays, surgeries, recovery therapies, and other costly activities that would have to occur in their place. A National Bureau of Economic Research study concluded that every dollar spent on prescription drugs led to a $2.06 reduction in overall Medicare expenditures. 

Furthermore, encouraging the utilization of prescription drugs in government programs could, according to the Congressional Budget Office, yield palpable fiscal gains for taxpayers. CBO concluded that for every 1 percent increase in prescriptions filled for Medicare participants, spending on medical services within the program falls by 0.2 percent. Even higher payoffs may be possible for those with chronic conditions. 

Fact-based, up-to-date research is needed to inform public policy on a consistent basis of how important the uniquely balanced U.S. system for prescription drugs can be for patients and taxpayers. CBO has an especially vital role to play in researching the fiscal benefits of a free market for all types of pharmaceuticals, as well as accurate appraisals of proposals such as price controls and importation. Without these, public officials could make serious mistakes that will endanger Americaâs health, economic prosperity, and fiscal stability.

    <content type="text">By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Clinical Trials Week  Research findings on Clinical Research - Clinical Trials and Studies are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting from Boston, Massachusetts, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Prescription drug shortages can disrupt essential patient care and drive up drug prices. To evaluate some predictors of shortages within a large cohort of generic drugs in the United States and to determine the association between drug shortages and changes in generic drug prices." 
 
The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Brigham and Women's Hospital, "This was a retrospective cohort study. Outpatient prescription claims from commercial health plans between 2008 and 2014 were analyzed. Seven years of data were divided into fourteen 6-month periods; the first period was designated as the baseline period. The first model estimated the probability of experiencing a drug shortage using drug-specific competition levels, market sizes, formulations (e.g., capsules), and drug prices as predictors. The second model estimated the percentage change in drug prices from baseline on the basis of drug shortage duration. From 1.3 billion prescription claims, a cohort of 1114 generic drugs was identified. Low-priced generic drugs were at a higher risk for drug shortages compared with medium- and high-priced generic drugs, with odds ratios of 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44-0.82) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.52-0.99), respectively. Compared with periods of no shortage, drug shortages lasting less than 6 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 18 months, and at least 18 months had corresponding price increases of 6.0% (95% CI 4.7-7.4), 10.9% (95% CI 8.5-13.4), 14.2% (95% CI 10.6-17.9), and 14.0% (95% CI 9.1-19.2), respectively. Study findings may not be generalizable to drugs that became generic after 2008 or those commonly used in an inpatient setting. The lowest priced drugs are at a substantially elevated risk of experiencing a drug shortage." 
 
According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Periods of drug shortages were associated with modest increases in drug prices."

    <content type="text">The incoming Senate Finance Committee leaders on Tuesday released a draft bill to address Medicaid drug rebate misclassifications that have cost taxpayers billions over the years, signaling that the pair plans to forge a bipartisan approach on an issue that often puts the parties at odds with each other. The draft by presumed Chairman Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon would give the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services the power to fine drug companies that knowingly misclassify whether a drug is brand-name or generic, which affects how much the government pays for the drug.

Grassley and Wyden would have the power to advance the bill through the Finance Committee when they take over during the 116th Congress. In a statement, however, Wyden expressed hope that it could clear in the next few weeks.

"This bipartisan bill will crack down on Big Pharma's games and help prevent them from taking advantage of Medicaid, a program meant to protect the most vulnerable," Wyden said. "I am hopeful that this legislation will become law by the end of the year and set the tone for the important work that lies ahead to lower prescription drug prices for families across the country."

Lowering drug prices could be an area of future bipartisan cooperation, given the general interest of President Donald Trump and Democrats.

The specific issue of Medicaid prices riled up Grassley in recent years after he began receiving complaints from his constituents about the high price of the EpiPen injector used to treat allergic reactions. In 2016, the $600 price tag for a two-pack, compared to around $150 a decade earlier, sparked congressional outrage and hearings.

The Iowan took it a step further and asked the Health and Human Services inspector general to investigate. The inspector general discovered that EpiPen manufacturer Mylan had not only been raising the prices for consumers but also overcharging the government.

EpiPen had no competition at the time. Even though the active ingredient, epinephrine, was discovered more than a century ago and is inexpensive, the injector is technically a brand-name product with exclusive rights to the design until 2015. In response to the outrage over the price, Mylan introduced its own "authorized generic," the same product without the EpiPen brand name, for half the price. It only received a generic competitor for the first time this year.

Despite its brand-name status, Mylan claimed that it was a generic drug for Medicaid reimbursement purposes. In exchange for Medicaid coverage, drugmakers must agree to give the program a rebate. But branded drugmakers pay a larger rebate. So by being classified as a generic, Mylan saved itself money -- and cost taxpayers $1.3 billion over 10 years.

The bill would allow HHS to penalize companies like Mylan up to two times the difference between the rebate amounts paid and the amounts that should have been paid.

"The EpiPen misclassification may be the tip of the iceberg," Grassley said in a Senate floor speech on Nov. 29. "It appears that some drug companies may be undermining the rebate program by misclassifying commonly prescribed drugs that can be found in medicine cabinets in households all across America. That's wrong. And I'm going to do whatever I can to fix it."

    <content type="text">I have been looking back at all of the work accomplished on health data exchange as well as some of the challenges that still remain.

In 2008, most of our healthcare system was still paper-based. Fewer than 10 percent of hospitals had implemented even a basic electronic health records system.

As we can see from thedata, provided by the Office of the Nation Coordinator (ONC), a great deal of progress occurred from 2008 to 2015. Of course, much of this was a result of the federal incentives for EHR adoption incorporated in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. The HITECH Act was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and signed into law on Feb. 17, 2009, to promote the adoption and meaningful use of health information technology.

HITECH provides financial incentives to "eligible professionals" and hospitals for the meaningful use of certified qualified electronic health records (EHRs). An eligible professional is generally a physician, although in the Medicaid program some mid-level providers were also included. CMS had major responsibility for the incentives (and penalties) hospitals and clinicians would receive broken into two separate programs, Medicare and Medicaid. With well over $30 billion in payments at stake, it is no wonder there was a sharp uptake in EHR adoption. The ONC is responsible for thecertification programfor health information technology, which is required to be eligible for a payment or to avoid a penalty. As part of HITECH, the ONC also oversaw the $564 millionState Health Information Exchange (HIE) Cooperative Agreement Program. In total, 56 states, eligible territories and qualified State Designated Entities (SDE) received awards.

This program was a big push towards interoperability and led to a rapid growth in the HIE market as well. As the work began to transition physicians and hospitals from paper-based to electronic systems it was critical for these systems to interoperate, allowing clinical data to flow between health care organizations.

Julia Adler-Milstein, from the Department of Health Management and Policy at the University of Michigan, along with David Bates and Ashish K. Jah, conducted a study published inHealth Affairsin 2013. The results showed progress as the number of operational HIE organizations identified rose from 55 in 2009 to 119 in 2012. There were still some concerns however. Some technical challenges remained but primarily the issue was around a sound and sustainable business model.

As the authors stated, "Long-term financial sustainability for organizations facilitating health information exchange appears to be the most pressing challenge. The fact that three-quarters of efforts cite developing a sustainable business model as a major barrier is a warning to policy makers that the growth in health information exchange will likely falter unless these efforts become self-sustaining or there is a long-term public commitment to their financing."

With no long-term commitment to public financing, and without a strong business model for sustainability on the horizon, many of these efforts began to falter at the end of the grant period. A 2016studyproduced by NORC under contract with the ONC that only a small number of states were successful with significantly developing and implementing sustainable HIE systems.

At the time of the study, seven of the grantees were no longer in business and even fewer are in operation today. With the continued growth in digitization of health records in 2018 more than 95 percent of hospitals and nearly 90 percent of office-based physicians have implemented an EHR. So we started to see a picture where we had traded paper siloes of the past to the largely digital siloes leading into the present.

To address many of the concerns on building out a national infrastructure for health information exchange, in 2012 the ONC announced its plan for enforcing Conditions of Trusted Exchange (CTE) and Network Validated Entities (NVE). This approach was quickly discarded (although components are revived under the current ONC plans we will discuss later).

During this time a very successful open source effort overseen by the ONC called theDirect Projectbegan. Launched as a part of what was then known as theNationwide Health Information Network(NHIN), the Direct Project was created to specify a simple, secure, scalable, standards-based way for participants to send authenticated, encrypted health information directly to known, trusted recipients over the Internet. The Direct Project had more than 200 participants from over 60 different organizations, of which I was honored to be a participant.

After developing the standards and specifications for Direct, a series of pilots were initiated. One of which was the HIE in Oregon, which I had started in 2010,Gorge Health Connect, using a HRSA Planning Grant. Using Medicity iNexx software, we were able to quickly set up a Health Information Service Provider (HISP) to enable Direct secure messaging between provider organizations.

Very soon after the Direct Project initiatives started to scale across the country, a serious issue came to light-we need a security and trust framework that would enable participants to have some levels of assurance around identity and strong security. Thus was born DirectTrust, a non-profit organization created to solve for these issues and I was happy to serve as a founding member of the Board of Directors.

In March 2013, DirectTrust was awarded an ONC Cooperative Agreement to further work in accreditation, trust anchor distribution services, and governance of the DirectTrust community. The Cooperative Agreement was renewed for another year in 2014. Part of theExemplar Health Information Exchange Governance Program, the grant was to "increase interoperability, decrease cost and complexity, and facilitate trust among participants using Direct for health information exchange of personal health information for health care improvements."

Direct secure messaging was soon incorporated in standards and certification criteria by the ONC for use in the EHR Incentive Program. And the ease of integrating into a clinicians' workflow made this a primary protocol for transitions of care. Those of us working on these efforts believed this could truly be a replacement for the fax machine in healthcare.

As David Kibbe, MD, chief executive officer of DirectTrust said in 2015, "In terms of new technology adoption, it's been pretty fast, If you look at the growth of Direct over the past two years-and it's only been three since it was available as a standard-it's pretty astounding. We're now up to 40,000 healthcare organizations that are contracted for Direct exchange by one of the HISPs in Direct Trust's network."

This year, the DirectTrust network saw 47.8 million health data exchange transactions in the first quarter, a 90 percent increase from the same time period in 2017. So we now have a way to push structured documents to known participants for clinical care.

But push is only half the story-what about querying for records? Remember the NHIN mentioned earlier-this was a cooperative established in 2004 under the ONC to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare by establishing a mechanism for nationwide health information exchange. The group included federal agencies, local, regional and state-level Health Information Exchange organizations and private companies.

In 2012 the ONC transitioned the NHIN exchange to the eHealth Exchange. The participants who implemented the standards and services and executed the Data Use and Reciprocal Support Agreement (DURSA) legal agreement were now in the eHealth Exchange.

Overseeing the eHealth Exchange and defined in the DURSA is the Exchange Coordinating Committee. Shortly thereafter the Coordinating Committee designated Healtheway, a new nonprofit organization, to assume operational support of eHealth Exchange effective Oct. 1, 2012. The ONC said that the transition to a public/private partnership reflected their strategy to be an incubator for innovation and a focus on supporting a sustainable ecosystem of organizations that have found secure and scalable ways to exchange health information.

The eHealth Exchange has grown tremendously in the past decade. It is the largest and most successful health information exchange network in the country. Thelist of participantscontinues to grow and includes the Department of Defense, the Veterans Health Administration and the Social Security Administration. In 2015 Healthewayrebranded itselfas The Sequoia Project.

Another important initiative overseen by The Sequoia Project isCarequality. Carequality was formed with an ambitious goal: to tie together the many valuable health information exchange activities occurring throughout the country, and solve the final mile of interoperability between them.

Another important effort began in 2013 named theCommonWell Health Alliancewhich went live in 2014. CommonWell, as it's commonly known, is a nonprofit trade association, working to make interoperability an inherent part of health IT. Compose initially of some of the major EHR vendors it has grown in scope and importance over the last four years. CommonWell was inspired by former National Coordinator at the ONC Farzad Mostashari, MD, during a 2012 Bipartisan Policy Committee meeting where he challenged the assembled health IT leaders to come up with a market-driven solution to the patient identity problem since the government was unable to address the problem for them. Arien Malec and Dr. David McCallie who were serving on the Federal Advisory Committee to the ONC took up the call and CommonWell was eventually born.

Now things have changed considerably, with the passage ofMACRAand the movement towards value-based care and payment models, and more recently the 21st Century Cures Act, which includes a number of interoperability provisions (including the TEFCA which I have written abouthere) there is a big policy push to improving interoperability. And the private market continues to innovate and technological solutions are flourishing.

Many of the standards and protocols for exchanging clinical information are developed by Health Level 7 orHL7. HL7 is a not-for-profit, ANSI-accredited standards developing organization dedicated to providing a comprehensive framework and related standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. And while messaging and structured documents are very important, healthcare has been slow to adopt modern web-based technologies used in other industries.

Then along came Graham Grieve and other thought leaders with the development ofHL7 FHIR(for those wondering what that stands for it is Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). FHIR is a standard describing data formats and elements (known as resources) and an application programming interface (API) for exchanging electronic health records.

In 2011 Grahampostedthat HL7 needed a fresh look. The work began with a small team at HL7 developing the standard and after five years it has finally gained a good deal of traction. In factApple has partneredwith a number of health systems to allow patients to access their health information right on their iPhone using the FHIR standards.

FHIR is designed specifically for the web and provides resources and foundations based on XML, JSON, HTTP, Atom and OAuth structures. Developers don't need a great deal of healthcare experience to quickly being coding since these are the same standards commonly used across the Internet. And with the federal government strongly promoting the use of open application programming interfaces (APIs), FHIR is positioned to meet the needs of the healthcare industry and help take us into the future of interoperability.

And the other private sector initiatives are not standing still. The Sequoia Project (where I serve on the Board of Directors) recently underwent a significant reorganization to position itself for the future. CommonWell has become a Carequality Implementer and the eHealth Exchange has become a member of Carequality and is in the process of becoming an implementer.

"By reorganizing the eHealth Exchange and Carequality into separate legal entities, we further ensure unbiased, equitable treatment for the eHealth Exchange alongside every other implementer subject to Carequality oversight," said Dave Cassel who heads up Carequality.</content>

Part 3 
 
By Alex Cordero 
 
Have you had the opportunity to take some time to review what will affect your Medicare plan coverage for 2019? If not, consider this time to be the right time. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) have announced the 2019 Medicare Parts A and B, premiums and deductibles. If this is not enough to get you excited about your Medicare Plan maybe their new form of obtaining information and resources will. 
 
The CMS is modernizing the way they do business for all their beneficiaries. For example they have updated their website. The website has been upgraded for easier and better navigation to be able to explore all the Medicare plans. In addition, all the information you need is at a one stop shop at Medicare.gov. The information found on the website is designed to empower the beneficiary to make better informed decisions about their health plan. You will be able to compare plans much easier. In addition, according to an article on cms.gov , as part of their new eMedicare initiative they released a mobile optimized out-of-pocket cost calculator that will provide information on both overall costs and prescription drug cost. Imagine how many pains you will save with this amazing tool designed with you in mind. 
 
Medicare costs are the main changes for 2019. These are not ridiculous amounts of increases in cost, and with the new mobile calculator you will be able to choose the Medicare plan that will best fit your budget. For example, one of the changes in cost is the inpatient care deductible that Part A covers. You will pay $1,364 when admitted to a hospital an increase of $24 from 2018. In Medicare Part B, beneficiaries will be paying a monthly premium of $135.50 in 2019. That is a $1.50 increase from 2018. In addition, in Part B members will pay an annual deductible of $185 in 2019. Overall Medicare Advantage will decline in cost while plan choices and new benefits will increase. It is estimated that Medicare Advantage will decrease by six percent in 2019. 
 
Please visit Medicare.gov to become an expert on Medicare. You may also obtain a 2019 fact sheet for Medicare Parts A &amp; B here . And for more detailed information on 2019 Medicare Parts A and B premiums and deductibles please visit this webpage .</content>

    <content type="text">âSo, let me get this straight,â Jud Anglin said.Â âWeâre going add millions of new citizens through our southern borders, provide â free â healthcare for all, while we are experiencing a severe doctor shortage at the same time?â 
 
I sat down this week with Jud Anglin, founder of MedRetreat and board member of the Laissez Faire Club. 
 
We had a long discussion about the story thatâs not being told on the caravan crisis. 
 
The highlights of this important interview will be published in these digital pages tomorrow. Stay tuned. 
 
Today, however, Jud Anglin will be âconnecting the horrendous demographic dotsâ of the migrant crisis and the ongoing push for Medicare-F0r-Allâ¦ 
 
Many politicos, as you know, are calling for open bordersÂ  andÂ  Medicare-For-Allâ¦ 
 
This only further guarantees that the entire shebang is going to implode. And when it does, as you can imagine, it wonât be pretty. 
 
But, says Jud, thereâs a way out. Jud has devoted his life to digging out the best healthcare alternatives and Obamacare âescape hatchesââ¦ 
 
In short, says Jud, itâs time to take matters into your own hands. His full report on the current healthcare crisis is below. 
 
Thereâs absolutelyÂ  no reasonÂ  you should have to sit around worrying about your healthcare â or worrying about going bankrupt over one accident or illness. 
 
Before you read on, Judâs collected all of his best-kept secrets in his new book, theÂ  Big Book of Health Secrets . 
 
It has over 132 simple, little-known healthcare industry secrets and loopholes to save thousands of dollars on hospital stays, doctors, and surgical proceduresâ¦ 
 
Up to 80% discounts on insurance premiums, prescription drugs, lab work, MRIs and CT examsâ¦ no matter your age, insurance, or income level.

  Will the Caravans Steal Your Healthcare?  
By Jud Anglin 
  
âMore than one-third of the 6,000 migrants in Tijuana, Mexico, are suffering from serious health issues, including tuberculosis, chickenpox, HIV/AIDS, and respiratory infections .â Fox News [i1] 
 
As the caravans crash our southern borders, the media talking-heads have avoided one important question like the plague. I certainly want answers. Especially since all the Democrats and the Republicans do is accuse each other of political gamesmanship regarding illegal aliens. 
 
The Democrats are the globalists who pine for open borders and millions of new voters to cement their electoral dominance from here to eternity.Â The Republicans want to appease their corporate backers, who want access to cheap labor. 
 
But rarely do you hear about the caravansâ effect on healthcare. In case you havenât considered the logical disconnect between the two political debates, allow me to inject sense serum into this debacle. 
 
Our political leaders prefer open borders in order to allow these caravans to flood our nation with millions of new illegal immigrants whileÂ  at the same time calling forÂ  Medicare-for-All. 
 
But itâs not just our political leaders that wantÂ  Medicare-for-All .Â According to a recent Reuters survey, 70 percent of Americans now support this idea. 
 
Medicare-for-All is, plain-and-simple, another term forÂ  Single-Payer healthcare , orÂ  Universal care . No matter how you slice the term, itâs stillÂ  socialized medicine . You pay a lot more taxes and the government will manage the entire system for free. 
 
So, let me get this straight.Â Weâre going add millions of new citizens through our southern borders, provide â free â healthcare for all,Â  while we are experiencing a severe doctor shortage at the same time? 
 
According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), âThe U.S. will be short more than 90,000 total physicians by 2020 and 130,000 physicians by 2025.â 
 
Add to this mess, the rapid rise in Baby Boomers are bleeding the Medicare trust fund dry.Â The fundâs board of trustees reported just this past summer that Medicare will become insolvent in 2026, three years earlier than previously forecasted. 
 
Now Iâll donât have a PhD in economics, but itâs certainly apparent our policy makers and mainstream news reporters have zero interest in connecting these horrendous demographic dots for you. 
 
Meanwhile, as these false-freebie narratives gain traction, the cost of your health continues to rise unabated.Â According to a recent report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), âThe growth in U.S. health care prices is projected to outpace economy-wide inflation for the first time since 2010.â 
 
Their projections indicate a 5.3% increase in overall health spending by the end of 2018. The total cost will hit approximately $3.7 trillion. 
 
These macro projections may cause your eyes to gloss over in boredom but having to pay an extra $10,000 to $20,000 a year on your healthcare arrangements hurt. Especially if you are fairly healthy. 
 
Donald Trump campaigned onÂ  repeal and replace Obamacare in order to lower the cost of care.Â Yet, even with a Republican majority in the House and Senate, he wasnât able to push forward with his reform agenda. 
 
Now, two years in, the Democrats have regained control of the House after the mid-term elections. So, if you were holding out for the Trump administration to lower the cost of your healthcare spending, youâre likely in for a long wait. 
 
Itâs High Time to Take MattersÂ into Your Own Hands 
 
The way I see it, if you havenât already done so, itâs high-time to take control of your own healthcare arrangements. 
 
The good news is that I have options for you to consider that will significantly lower your healthcare spending in 2019, without the help from Uncle Sam. 
 Medical Cost Sharing  
Since open enrollment is now upon us, you should strongly consider medical cost sharing. 
 
Several years ago, when I researched medical cost sharing programs for my family, I selected Liberty HealthShare.Â I found their program choices to be the most affordable, convenient, and friction-free for my family.Â And Iâd be remiss if I didnât state that their friendly support and simple communications were superb. 
 
With Liberty HealthShare, youâll obtain real freedom from insurance altogether.Â Plus, youâll be connected to a fast-growing community of like-minded, caring, health-conscious individuals who simply share each otherâs medical bills. 
 
A significant advantage is that you wonât be confined to any restrictive network- of doctors and hospitals.Â Youâll have the freedom to see any doctor you want. 
 
Their monthly member sharing amounts are as low as $199, with up to one million dollars per incident sharing for eligible medical bills. Itâs real healthcare freedom thatâs amazingly affordable.

 Global Healthcare  
Imagine an all-inclusive bundled-priced heart by-pass procedure for only $1,600 and comes with the exact same mortality and infection rates for the same procedure performed at the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic, which charges approximately $100,000. 
 
Impossible? Not at all! 
 
According to Dr. David Hyman, author ofÂ  Overcharged, Why Americans Pay Too Much for Healthcare , global healthcare pays big dividends. 
 
This $1,600 price tag can be found atÂ  Narayana Hospital in Bangalore, India. Now if you are thinking that this hospital is some old dilapidated hut in the slums, youâd be sorely mistaken. 
 
How do I know? As the founder of MedRetreat , the first medical tourism facilitation agency in the US, Iâve had the privilege to visit many hospitals around the world. I can tell you first-hand that there are many advanced, state-of-the-art, highly accredited facilities in most countries. To find a good hospital outside the US, your best bet would be to start with the Joint Commission , the accreditation organization that accredits US hospitals on safety, procedures, protocols, and standards. 
 Retail Healthcare.  
The most obvious way to save money on healthcare is to remain healthy and avoid high risk activities.Â But letâs face it, life happens. Flu, bacterial infections, osteoporosis, car wrecks, or even a minor a slip on an icy sidewalk can easily crush your wallet, unless you know your options. 
 
In emergency situations, you have a big decision to make.Â Call 911, or head straight to the nearest hospital if you can.Â But what if your condition is not all that critical. 
 
With higher deductibles and co-pays, youâll need to conduct a quick cost-benefit analysis, since more money will be coming out of your pocket. 
 
Itâs important to understand that the hospital is by far your most expensive option.Â According to healthcare.gov, the average hospital stay in the US is $10,000 per day. 
 
But the cost is not your only concern.Â According to an NPR report, medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US, behind health disease and cancer. 
 
Itâs worth repeating that if your situation is life-threatening, the hospital will be your best bet. 
 
For all other conditions you should first considerÂ  retail health .Â The retail health sector includes urgent care centers, Target, Walmart, CVS Minute Clinic.Â The savings in the retail sector are enormous. 
 
Most urgent care centers are open seven days a week. No appointments are required, and they are staffed by emergency room physicians and family care doctors. 
 
The average wait time at an urgent care center is less than 30 minutes, according to the American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine. Compare that with your local hospital ER, where wait times for nonlife-threatening conditions can exceed five hours. 
 
My suggestion is to research all the retail health options in your area before you need medical treatment of any kind.Â Review the services that the offer, hours of operations, and cost of treatment.

    <content type="text">DUBLIN, Ireland , Dec. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DELopen, an open platform based on block chain technology, supported by WuXi AppTec Co. LTD., Y-gene Biotech Co., Ltd., and academia/institutions dedicated to the development and application of DNA Encoded Library (DEL) Technology, announced its launch to better connect industry and academia to utilize DEL technology in drug discovery via its website DELopen.org. 

Pioneered by Dr. Richard A. Lerner and Dr. Sydney Brenner in 1992, boosted by the revolution of next gen sequencing in the early 2000's, DEL has gradually become a disruptive drug discoveryÂ  alternative to traditional high-throughput screening, evidenced by multiple examples of DEL compounds entering clinical trials. In the past decade, most of the major pharmaceutical companies have started accessing this technology via internal effort or external partnerships. In contrast to high throughput screening, DEL requires very small amount s of target protein and minimum assay development. DEL selection can also be performed on benchtop and does not require complex instrumentation. Most importantly, it disrupts the concept of "cost-per-well" and allows testing billions of compounds in one test tube. However, due to the nature of DEL technology, heavy investment must be made in the upfront library synthesis, and also downstream data mining and management, limiting the access for academia and individual companies. To date, most of the collaborations take a fee-based format between library providers and screeners. In-depth collaboration in these relationships has also been limited by intellectual property complications. Providing an effective method for information sharing and protection of intellectual property through a neutral third-party platform will undoubtedly bring changes to the whole industry. 

In their insightful article "DNA-Encoded Compound Libraries as Open Source: A Powerful Pathway to New Drugs" (2016), Dr. Lerner and Dr. Brenner wrote, "We envision a system that operates as follows. A pharmaceutical or a biotech company provides an encoded library, but not the code, to a researcher. The researcher does a binding assay on the bench top and carries out the PCR on the binding molecules to read the code in the form of DNA sequences. These sequences are returned to the owner of the library who now knows the nature of the molecules bound as well as some of their structureâactivity relationships from truncated molecules. If the nature of the discovered molecules looks interesting, then everyone wins. The pharmaceutical company gets a drug lead and the researcher gets a tool compound to help further dissect the role of the target molecule in health and disease. Of course, such collaborations will be accompanied by license relation-ships so that the partners both share in a commercial success. In the end, the problem reduces to the question of how will creators of huge libraries make them an open source for academia?" 

The goal of the DELopen platform is to provide free access of DEL libraries owned by participating partners to academic users for research in drug discovery. Blockchain technology will assist in proving the IP assets, origin, and proof of ownership, without any disclosure of data. We envision that the new platform provides full protection of intellectual properties for both user and technology provider thus lowers the IP barrier and promotes in-depth collaboration. Ultimately, the industry/academia alliance will unlock the true potential of DEL technology for future drug discovery. 

"This is a game changer to worldwide drug discovery. I am grateful that WuXi, with its superior chemical capability, will open this opportunity to academic researchers to advance the discovery effort and technology," sai dÂ D r. Richard A. Lerner .Â  

"DELopen is surely going to create a revolutionary discovery platform not only in the pharmaceutical industry but also in biomedical research in general. The past decade has fully demonstrated the potential and utilities of DEL as a drug discovery tool," said Xiaoyu Li , Chief scientist from Y-gene Biotech Co., Ltd. "Now DELopen has extended the power of DEL with the innovative strength of academic and institutional researchers. We are extremely excited by the opportunity and thrilled to be able to contribute to this initiative." 

About DELopen 

DELopen is a platform connecting industry and academic research institutions to promote the sharing of scientific research information and the protection of intellectual property. Through DELopen, researchers and institutions engaged in the development of new drugs with DEL technology can more quickly conduct early drug development and push the results to commercialization as soon as possible.

The company has developed a number of leading DEL preparation and selection technologies, established an innovative drug discovery platform, and has been providing rapid and effective library screening services to meet the drug discovery needs of customers worldwide. 

About Blockchain technology 

Blockchain is a tamper-proof digital ledger that records activity in a transparent, secure, and accessible format. As a tool for improving security, transparency, and efficiency, its potential applications in the pharmaceutical and medical industries are numerous. Intellectual property is arguably the most significant aspect of any new drug, as the core and most critical part of a patent is its Composition of Matter. In the patent office, proving a patent requires four aspects: 

* Proof of creator 
* When was it created? 
* What was included on the date of creation? 
* Proof that the content was not altered 

Use of blockchain, in this case, will assist in proving the IP assets, origin, and proof of ownership, without any disclosure of data.

By RICHARD CHEVREFILS 
For the Monitor  
Friday, December 07, 2018 
  
Anyone who wants to be the next president needs to protect seniors, not drug company profits. 

Congress did a good thing earlier this year when it passed a law to help Americaâs seniors pay less for their prescription drugs. But now, big drug companies are spending millions trying to strong-arm members of Congress into breaking the deal just to boost their own profits. 

This would be a terrible blow to seniors. More than 40 million older Americans rely on the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit to help them pay for life-saving medicines. Unfortunately, an increasing number of them have to decide between putting food on the table and filling their prescriptions. 

Consider this: AARPâs Public Policy Institute found that the average annual retail price for widely used brand name prescription drugs was nearly $6,800 in 2017. For the average older American who takes 4.5 brand name prescription drugs on a chronic basis, their annual cost of therapy would have been more than $30,000 â over 20 percent higher than the median annual income for Medicare beneficiaries. 

In a 2015 AARP survey of the 50-plus in New Hampshire, 85 percent said that affording health care and prescription drugs was extremely or very important to them. Whatâs more, nearly half (48 percent) said they worry about being able to afford their prescription drugs. 

The law passed earlier this year required drug manufacturers to provide a bigger discount on their brand name drugs for the Medicare beneficiaries who are in the Part D doughnut hole. This critical reform, if allowed to continue, would save seniors an estimated $6.7 billion between 2020 and 2027. 

Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, wants Congress to roll back this yearâs Part D deal, which would deliver $4 billion more in profits to pharmaceutical companies over 10 years. The industry is the last one that needs to make more money off seniors and taxpayers. In 2016 alone, Medicare Part D paid $141 billion to drug companies. 

These same big drug companies who reap tens of billions of dollars annually from Medicare Part D are trying to get Congress to reverse the savings it delivered to seniors earlier this year. These companies are spending millions on advertising and lobbying targeting Congress. What a waste. Those millions could be devoted to developing drugs to treat diseases such as Alzheimerâs and Parkinsonâs. 

And thereâs an ironic disconnect. President Donald Trump has been talking a lot lately about how unfair it is that Americans pay the highest drug prices in the world. But just months after Congress made progress toward lowering drug costs, some members of Congress are preparing to side with the drug lobby rather than look after their own constituentsâ interests, which align with the presidentâs position. 

A deal is a deal. AARPâs 230,000 members in New Hampshire are not going to sit by and let this happen. 

Senators and others who want to be president, take note. When you come to our community, be prepared to show that you have what it takes to stand up to big drug companies. Older Americans vote â a majority of voters in the 2018 election were over 50 â and they will remember whether presidential candidates stand by seniors or sided with big drug companies to raise the cost of prescription drugs.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar wants to make prescription-drug pricing more transparent. We agree, but his well-intentioned plan will only confuse and mislead consumers. Whatâs the good of listing drug prices in advertising if almost no one pays that âlist price?â When patients say, âMy drugs are too expensive,â theyâre not talking about the list price â theyâre talking about their co-pays at the pharmacy. 

While pharmaceutical companies determine a drugâs list price, known as the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) determine what patients will actually pay for those drugs. These âpayersâ negotiate discounts and rebates from drug companies that can reach 40 percent or 50 percent off the WAC price. Unfortunately, these health-care middlemen keep much of those savings and pass only a paltry portion of the discounts on to consumers. 

Even more troubling is that unlike other health-care sectors, patientsâ co-pays and co-insurance are often based on the higher list price rather than the significantly discounted payer cost. According to a 2017 study by Amundsen Consulting, more than 50 percent of commercially insured patientsâ out-of-pocket spending for brand name biopharmaceuticals was based on full list price, with no discounts included. 
 
When patients complain about the high cost of drugs itâs because their co-pays have grown significantly. Today many insurers require a co-insurance payment of 20 percent to 40 percent of the cost for innovative drugs for serious and life-threatening conditions such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. 

Over the last five years, pharmaceutical spending has increased by 38 percent while the average individual health-insurance premium has increased by 107 percent. During this same period, rebates, discounts and fees paid by the biopharmaceutical industry to insurers and PBMs have risen from $74 billion to $153 billion. 
 
Fortunately, President Trump and Congress have taken some steps in the right direction. The president recently signed legislation outlawing PBM-imposed âgag clauses,â which prohibited many pharmacists from voluntarily informing customers that paying for a drug out of pocket was less expensive than their co-pay. And Food and Drug Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is working to increase competition between brand name companies and generics. 
 
A key problem with Mr. Azarâs transparency effort is that it doesnât provide consumers with any context or insights into the complexity of the drug-pricing ecosystem. Nor does it change the convoluted incentives that leave most of the negotiated savings with middlemen instead of patients. 

Whatâs the solution? Real, complete, honest consumer-friendly pricing transparency that gives patients the ways and means to become smarter, savvier, value-conscious shoppers in the health-care marketplace by giving them clear, understandable and relevant pricing information. 

Rather than opting for the cheap, politically expedient trick of âblaming Big Pharma,â our national leadership should insist that all members of the health-care ecosystem create expert-vetted, user-friendly education programs so that patients know the real costs of what theyâre buying, where the profits are going and, most importantly, how they can use this knowledge to become savvier consumers.

    <content type="text">The U.S. Department of Justice issued the following news release:

Pharmaceutical company Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion), based in South San Francisco, California, has agreed to pay $360 million to resolve claims that it illegally used a foundation as a conduit to pay the copays of thousands of Medicare patients taking Actelion's pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs, in violation of the False Claims Act, the Justice Department announced today.

When a Medicare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug covered by Medicare, the beneficiary may be required to make a partial payment, which may take the form of a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible (collectively "copays"). These copay obligations may be substantial for expensive medications. Congress included copay requirements in the Medicare program, in part, to serve as a check on health care costs, including the prices that pharmaceutical manufacturers can demand for their drugs. Under the Anti-Kickback Statute, a pharmaceutical company is prohibited from offering or paying, directly or indirectly, any remuneration--which includes money or any other thing of value-- to induce Medicare patients to purchase the company's drugs. This prohibition extends to the payment of patients' copay obligations.

Actelion sells a number of pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs, including Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri, and Opsumit (the "Subject Dugs"). The government alleged that Actelion used a foundation, which claims 501(c)(3) status for tax purposes, as an illegal conduit to pay the copay obligations of thousands of Medicare patients taking the Subject Drugs and to induce those patients to purchase them, because it knew that the prices Actelion set for the Subject Drugs could otherwise pose a barrier to those purchases. From 2014 to 2015, Actelion made donations to the foundation, which, in turn, used those donations to pay copays of patients prescribed the Subject Drugs. The government alleged that Actelion routinely obtained data from the foundation detailing how much the foundation had spent for patients on each Subject Drug; it then used this information to decide how much to donate to the foundation and to confirm that its contributions were sufficient to cover the copays of only patients taking the Subject Drugs. The Government further alleged that Actelion engaged in this practice even though the foundation had warned the company against receiving such information. The Government also alleged that, meanwhile, Actelion had a policy of not permitting Medicare patients to participate in its free drug program, which was open to other financially needy patients, even if those Medicare patients could not afford their copays for the Subject Drugs. Instead, to generate revenue from Medicare and induce purchases of the Subject Drugs, the government alleged that Actelion referred such Medicare patients to the foundation, which allowed the patients copays to be paid and resulted in claims to Medicare for the remaining cost.

"This settlement, like prior settlements concerning similar misconduct, makes clear that the government will hold accountable companies that pay illegal kickbacks," said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice's Civil Division. "Pharmaceutical companies cannot increase drug prices while engaging in conduct designed to defeat mechanisms put in place to check such prices and then expect Medicare to pay for the ballooning costs."

"Using data from CVC that it knew it should not have, Actelion effectively set up a proprietary fund to cover the co-pays of just its own drugs," said United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling for the District of Massachusetts. "Such conduct not only violates the anti-kickback statute, it also undermines the Medicare program's co-pay structure, which Congress created as a safeguard against inflated drug prices. During the period covered by today's settlement, Actelion raised the price of its main PAH drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of overall inflation in the United States."

"Today's settlement against Actelion is a victory for the public and underscores the FBI's commitment to safeguarding the financial integrity of the Medicare program," said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division. "Simply put, the goal of the FBI's Health Care Fraud program is to ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatments and therapies according to their medical needs, without corrupt or profit-driven influence of drug manufacturers."

"Kickback schemes can undermine our healthcare system, compromise medical decisions, and waste taxpayer dollars," said Phillip Coyne, Special Agent in Charge, Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Service's Boston Regional Office. "We will continue to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for subverting the charitable donation process in order to circumvent safeguards designed to protect the integrity of the Medicare program."

The government's resolution of this matter illustrates the government's emphasis on combating healthcare fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, can be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services at 800-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).

The investigation was conducted by the Justice Department's Civil Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General; and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

On June 16, 2017, after the conduct alleged in today's settlement agreement, Johnson &amp; Johnson acquired Actelion. The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.

    <content type="text">Adventist Health System (AHS), which includes Central Texas Medical Center, has been named a 2018 Most Wired award winner by the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME). This is the sixth straight year AHS has been honored with the award that identifies and recognizes health care organizations that exemplify best practices through their adoption, implementation and use of information technology. "We live in a world where medical technology is constantly evolving. Being part of an organization that prioritizes innovation and technology resources is really what gives us the tools to deliver exceptional care to our patients," CTMC President/CEO Anthony Stahl said.

For the first time in the award's 20-year history, only the top 25 percent of respondents were recipients of the award due to a more rigorous selection process. Adventist Information Technology (AIT), the organization's IT department, manages and oversees its business systems and information technology solutions across its hospitals, home health and hospice agencies, skilled nursing facilities, physician practices and business offices.

According to the survey, two key areas emerged in 2018: the use of foundational technologies such as integration, interoperability, security and disaster recovery; and the use of transformational technologies to support population health management, value-based care, patient engagement and telehealth.

"Health care IT has the potential to revolutionize care around the world, but to meet that potential it must be used strategically," Russell Branzell, president and CEO of CHIME, said. "The technology is important, but leadership and a strategic vision are equally important. The diversity of the organizations that earned Most Wired status this year shows quality care can be achieved almost anywhere under the right leadership. By sharing the best practices in Most Wired, we hope quality care will one day be available everywhere."

CTMC The hospital, which originated in 1923 as Hays County Soldiers, Sailors and Marines Memorial Hospital, opened at its current Wonder World Drive location in 1983. The CTMC staffof more than 700 employees works with more than 300 active and consulting physicians to provide quality services to patients and their families. For more than 20 consecutive years, CTMC has been named The Best Hospital in Hays County in the annual "Best of Hays" publication released by the San Marcos Daily Record. In addition to interventional cardiac services, CTMC is a Certified Chest Pain Center and an accredited Primary Stroke Center. CTMC leads the region in da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery and offers a variety of specialty care services including medical imaging, rehabilitation, home health care, hospice, women's services and more.

    <content type="text">The indefensibly high price of EpiPens has been a problem since 2007, when the drug company Mylan acquired the product and jacked up the price from a little more than $100 for a two-pack to more than $600. The industry expectation was that the price would fall as generics hit the market, but the price remains out of whack. The high price victimizes families with children who have severe allergies. To ensure epinephrine is immediately at hand in an emergency, families typically keep several injectors in their homes, another in the child's backpack, perhaps another in the car, as well as in other places. Schools stock them, and Gov. Bruce Rauner in July signed a bill to encourage police officers to use the injectors in emergencies by protecting the officers from liability.

The injectors expire after 12 to 18 months, which adds to the cost, and health insurance plans often cover only a fraction of the cost.

EpiPen technology was developed 50 years ago for use in the U.S. military. The pens contain only about $1 worth of epinephrine. Much of the balance of the price amounts to pure price-gouging.

President Donald Trump has talked about the problem of high drug prices, but his administration has not made a consistent effort to lower prices. Even as the Department of Health and Human Services seeks to peg drug costs to much lower prices in other countries, the Trump administration's chief trade representative is pushing a plan to significantly boost the cost of foreign drugs.

That certainly would make American drugs more competitive, but in the wrong direction.

U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., who has pushed various measures to reduce drug prices, told us Monday that Democrats plan to make "outrageous" drug prices a top priority in the next Congress. The pharmaceutical companies charge the high prices only "because they can," she said.

The best solution is a more robust free market, with more EpiPen generics coming on line quickly.

Short of that, it's up to the Trump administration and Congress to end the price-gouging.

    <content type="text">Support for restaurant in Flagler park 

After reading about the small, vocal group of people who are protesting against the already approved lease agreement between Captainâs BBQ and Flagler County (Dec. 4, âFlagler rethinks lease for eatery at parkâ), I wanted to show my support for this wonderful, top-rated local BBQ restaurantâs expansion plans at Bingâs Landing. 

[READ:Flagler rethinks restaurant lease; will weigh firing county administrator] 

I know there are many others who, like me, are excited about the planned expansion. The new restaurant will not take anything away from the county parkâs beauty or access to those who enjoy going there. I for one cannot wait for the new restaurant!

Thoughts on Captainâs 

Iâve been to Captainâs BBQ many times. Was there just last week. Place is an asset to the area. Clean, food is lunchy and competently served. You even get your name announced on a speaker. 

[READ: Residents vow to fight restaurant expansion at Flagler County park] 

Outside there is evidence to me of repair on the building. Seems to me that an able engineer and a good construction company could right what is wrong with the structure. Maybe even find a place for a small bar. 

The park was busy on a cool, breezy day. The trees that dominate are mature and magnificent. To remove them would be a bloody shame. Even for a Bloody Mary! 

Sal Rapisarda, Palm Coast 

Donât stifle speech 

President Trump should come to the realization that he, and he alone, creates the bulk of the news he considers negative. Doesnât it follow, then , that if most news about him from all sources is negative, a search result is going to yield mostly negative news? Maybe he should also come to the realization that most of America does not like him, for myriad reasons. Remember,he lost the popular vote in the election by over 3 million votes. His popularity ratings are pitiful. 

Maybe he should also realize that he simply cannot thwart the news or any social media outlet, search engine or feed from exercising its First Amendment rights to publish any information, positive or negative, from a left, center, or right view. 

That he would even ponder regulating free speech suggests he is a tyrant. Maybe he should realize that he belongs anywhere but in the U.S., where we respect the rights of our media to freely speak for or against the government.

Healthcare facts 

The Nov. 24 letter âFacts are factsâ was incorrect with facts regarding Medicare For All saving $2 trillion over 10 years. 

The study wasnât sponsored by the Koch brothers. âThe Costs of a National Single-Payer Healthcare Systemâ was published by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The center gets some of its funding from the Koch brothers. The author of the paper cited is Charles Blahous. According to the paper, even doubling all âcurrently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan.â 

Blahous wrote, âIt is likely that the actual cost of the (Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plan) would be substantially greater than these estimates, which assume significant administrative and drug cost savings under the plan, and also assume that healthcare providers â¦ will be reimbursed at rates more than 40 percent lower than those currently paid.â 

Weâre already seeing thousands of doctors retiring early or changing careers because of the current low reimbursement, and premiums continue to rise. To what country do the ill come for the best medical care in the world? Why do Canadians come south when they canât wait four to six months for urgent medical care? 

It would be hard to name one Federal program that hasnât ended up costing extremely more than promised. I and millions of Americans are still waiting for that $2,500 annual savings of Obamacare and âyou can keep your doctorâ and âkeep your (insurance) plan.â

Nicklaus Children's will initially leverage Health Catalyst's powerful, cloud-based Data Operating System (DOSâ¢) to facilitate appropriate payment for services, and to better understand the costs of healthcare. Nicklaus Children's Health System includes the flagship 309-bed nonprofit Nicklaus Children's Hospital, South Florida's only licensed specialty hospital exclusively for children, as well as a network of outpatient centers situated in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, a physician group and an ambulatory surgery center. Nicklaus Children's Hospital has won numerous awards for clinical and IT excellence, including recently being named the 2018 Most Wired Hospital by CHIME, and has been designated as a Magnet facility for the high quality of its nursing care. In addition, six of the hospital's medical units have received Beacon Awards from the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, a distinction no other children's hospital in the nation currently holds.

"We look forward to leveraging analytics to impact many areas at Nicklaus Children's," said Ed Martinez, the health system's CIO. "We chose Health Catalyst as our partner because of its track record of outcomes improvement and its ability to match up technology with improvement services. Health Catalyst brings capabilities that will enable us to identify new opportunities to better serve our patients, physicians, employees, and community."

Analyzing revenues and costs

Like most healthcare organizations, Nicklaus Children's has faced increasing margin pressures, and its leaders recognize the need to enhance management of revenues and costs. To do that, they required a robust solution that would trend and benchmark financial data so they could identify areas to improve, starting with their revenue cycle. The health system selected Health Catalyst's DOS to contribute to that goal.

Working with Nicklaus Children's existing IT systems, DOS will serve as the hospital's digital analytics backbone. The platform can integrate critical data from over 200 of the most popular data sources, including third-party electronic medical records (EMRs), data warehouses, claims processing systems, financial systems, operational systems and patient experience survey data. Moreover, DOS includes a large suite of products and analytic accelerators that are optimized with machine learning and natural language processing. These flexible solutions will help to meet Nicklaus Children's needs for revenue cycle management and operational performance improvement initiatives. They will also enable the health system to monitor payer contracts to make sure that payers aren't under-reimbursing or incorrectly denying claims.

"We're excited to partner with Nicklaus Children's Health System to harness the power of data to identify opportunities for strengthening its financial base while supporting patient outcomes," said Dan Burton, CEO of Health Catalyst. "The DOS platform, along with Health Catalyst's proven outcomes improvement services, will help Nicklaus Children's get a firm grip on its financial management and ensure that their patients continue to receive first-rate care."

Under the agreement, Nicklaus Children's will have access to Health Catalyst's library of technology solutions built on the DOS platform, as well as content culled from the company's outcomes-improvement work with health systems across the country. Health Catalyst applications address some of the most pressing concerns of healthcare organizations, including managing population health; gaining a comprehensive view of the true cost of care; empowering executive decision support with a dashboard view of enterprise-wide performance; benchmarking and prioritizing improvement opportunities; and monitoring, detecting, predicting and preventing patient safety concerns before harm can occur.

    <content type="text">HARTFORD, Conn., Dec. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CareCentrix announced today that its unique employee funded "CareCentrix Cares" program has delivered over half a million dollars in charitable help to more than 230 fellow employees in need. In 2015, CareCentrix leadership saw the opportunity to create a charitable vehicle to meet the needs of employees who were going through difficult circumstances. The CareCentrix Cares program allows team members to make voluntary and anonymous donations from their pay checks to a fund that helps team members in times of crisis or need. "The CareCentrix Cares program was built on the premise that we care about our team members, and the promise that in difficult times, we wanted to help," John Driscoll, CareCentrix CEO, explained. "We cannot prevent bad things from happening, but we knew we could do more to help members of our teams who were in crisis." 

Like many other companies, CareCentrix supports community-based non-profits and nationwide causes. What makes this program unique is that it is organized and funded by employees, for employees. 

The CareCentrix Cares program is managed by an outside charitable organization so that all requests can be handled anonymously. The program has supported CareCentrix employees across the country through a series of difficult challenges. 

"The CareCentrix Cares Program really helped me out in my time of need. I had an unexpected visit to the hospital in the beginning of the year and was not prepared for how much it would cost me. The application process was smooth and the response time was fast." - CareCentrix Team Member

"Thanks to this program I was nearly able to pay off my hospital bill and had a lot of stress taken off me. I am glad that CareCentrix offers such a program and am happy with making contributions to it and helping people out in their time of need."- CareCentrix Team Member

"My son passed away unexpectedly and unfortunately I did not have life insurance on him. My manager advised me to apply for CareCentrix Cares to help with the costs of his funeral, which I did. It was approved by the program and I was granted $2,500. I really appreciate that I was approved as it helped greatly." - CareCentrix Team Member

"I recently relocated to Florida due to a domestic incident. I was living with my friend and her family of 8 and dog with myself and my two sons. I was trying to save up money to get our own place but it was somewhat of a challenge due to having to contribute to buying groceries for everyone and keep up the maintenance on both of my cars since the family was using the one I wasn't driving. I was aware of the program but not how it worked. One of my co-workers advised me to look more into the program and I'm forever grateful that I did. Thanks to the program I was able to get reimbursed some of the money I had to pay out during our transition. The program even reimbursed me the deposit I had to pay upfront to save my spot for our new apartment along with one month of rent down for us as well. This year started out very rocky for me and my kids but thanks to CareCentrix and this program we are now seeing better days ahead, so I wanted to let others know my story and say thank you from the bottom of my heart to the founders of the program." - CareCentrix Team Member

"At CareCentrix, we are building a culture of caring for each other. I am proud of this incredible organization where the majority of our employees voluntarily contribute from their pay checks to support one another. I hope that all other companies follow our example," Driscoll added.

    <content type="text">US lawmakers have asked drugmakers to clarify why they have used savings following tax law changes for share repurchases instead of reducing drug prices, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. "[Drugmakers] benefited greatly from the tax cut and we want to know what theyâre doing with that money, and whatâs happening with their drug prices," remarked US Representative Jan Schakowsky, adding "we're going to have in-depth hearings about pharmaceuticals and I think you're going to see some legislative action dealing with transparency and actually lower drug prices." Among specific companies, Amgen, which increased its repurchases by from $2.37 billion to $15.67 billion, said it build a new plant in Rhode Island instead of overseas due to the tax breaks. Additionally, the company indicated that it has been taking steps to reduce the price of Repatha by entering into 30 contracts with health plans linking reimbursement to its value. The lawmakers additionally chided Amgen for raising the price of Enbrel by 70 percent between 2011 and 2015 and questioned AbbVie's decision to increase the price of Humira by 9.7 percent in January. AbbVie stated that it gave every non-executive employee a $1000 pay raise and pledged to invest $2.5 billion in capital projects over the next five years.</content>

    <content type="text">Itâs easy to forget that for stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the most bullish start to a month since 2015 was only four days ago.

Blame tech and health care for derailing things this week. Any optimism on a trade truce was quickly unraveled when news broke that the U.S. had requested the arrest of a senior executive at Huawei Technologies Co. Shares of the companyâs peers and its vast supply chain sank on concern theyâll take a hit from the Trump administrationâs crackdown on Chinese technology. (Click here for a reminder of what happened to ZTE Corp.âs profits.)

What followed was a $26 billion wipeout of Chinaâs health-care stocks after Beijingâs expected but awfully timed decision to slash drug prices in a government procurement list from 11 major Chinese cities. The cuts were far worse than analysts had predicted, as shown by the worst two-day rout in more than 13 years for MSCI Inc.âs gauge tracking the sector.

Only a miracle can bring Hong Kongâs equity market into the black for 2018. The cityâs benchmark has flipped between gains and losses for seven straight weeks, and would need its biggest December rally since 1993 even to just end the year where it started. This quarter, which is historically one of the best ones, is turning out to be the worst since China shocked traders three years ago with its currency devaluation.

The yuan was perhaps the biggest winner after Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump said they wonât announce any new tariffs for 90 days. While the currency pared gains in the latter part of the week, it still clocked in its best performance since September 2017.

Havens continued to be well bid, with Chinese government bonds benefiting from a flight to quality even as a former Peopleâs Bank of China governor suggested traders shouldnât expect big sweeping monetary stimulus measures any time soon. A variety of sovereign-bond auctions found solid investor appetite this week.

This is proving to be a big sell signal for chart watchers. The Shanghai Composite Index failed to hold above its 50-day moving average for a fourth time this year.

Hereâs what else caught our eye.</content>

    <content type="text">Healthcare spending in the United States decelerated once again in 2017 to a growth rate of 3.9%, nearly a full percentage point lower than 2016, according to new statistics released by the federal government on Thursday. It's the second consecutive year that healthcare spending has slowed, stabilizing healthcare's share of the nation's gross domestic product at 17.9%. Healthcare spending totaled $3.5 trillion, or $10,739 per person, and grew at a slightly slower rate of the overall GDP.

The lower rate is attributed to slower growth in the use and intensity of services in hospitals, clinics and physician offices, which make up 63% of healthcare spending, according to data released by the Office of the Actuary at the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and published in Health Affairs.

Hospital spending, which accounts for a third of healthcare expenditures, grew 4.4% in 2017 to $1.1 trillion compared to 5.6% in 2016. Outpatient services decelerated, while inpatient days increased at roughly the same rate. Physician and clinical services spending growth dropped to 4.2% from 5.6% in 2016.

RELATED: Slower healthcare employment growth is necessary to curb costs, researchers say

Retail prescription drug spending increased just 0.4% to $333.4 billion, down from 2.3% in 2016, thanks primarily to a decrease in the number of prescriptions dispensed. The crackdown on opioid prescriptions played a significant role, according to Anne Martin, lead author of the study and an economist in the National Health Statistics Group at the CMS Office of the Actuary.

âThe number of prescriptions for pain had a large impact on the trend and a lot of that did have to do with opioid epidemic and tightening of prescriptions being dispensed,â she said on a call with reporters.

Overall healthcare spending growth began slowing in 2016 when it hit 4.8%. That's a correction from last year's report, which pegged the growth rate at 4.3%. Researchers clarified that the growth rate was revised to account for $23.8 billion in additional spending that was not factored in last year.

Healthcare spending growth picked up in 2014 and 2015 due primarily to new coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces and Medicaid expansion. Though the use and intensity of medical services has declined, medical prices have grown, accounting for half of the per capita health spending growth rate. Overall, the federal government's healthcare spending grew 3.2% in 2017, down from 4.9% the previous year.

    <content type="text">An industrywide probe of pharma's charity contributions has spawned multimillion-dollar kickback settlements, and Actelion is the latest to make a deal with the feds.

The Johnson &amp; Johnson unit inked a $360 million settlement on Thursday to wrap upallegations that its charity contributions served as kickbacks to boost use of its pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs. It's the largest settlement so far as the Department of Justice digs into a number of drugmakers' contributions to charities that help patients pay for their medications. Drugmakers are prohibited from paying Medicare patient copays, and the government said Actelion used a "purportedly independent" patient foundation as a conduit to do just that. In 2014 and 2015, the feds said, Actelion gotahold of a foundation's data on patients using Actelion drugs and the charity's spending on those patients. The company then used the data to budget future donations to the foundation, authorities said, and instead referred Medicare patients to the foundation, which paid their co-pays.

âUsing data from a foundation that it knew it should not have, Actelion effectively set up a proprietary fund to cover the copays of just its own drugs,â U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said in a statement. âSuch conduct not only violates the anti-kickback statute, it also undermines the Medicare program's co-pay structure, which Congress created as a safeguard against inflated drug prices.'

During the period covered by the DOJsettlement, Actelion raised the price of its leading PAH drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of overall inflation in the U.S., Lelling said.

RELATED: Pfizer inks $23.8M deal to settle Justice Department's charity kickback probe

Actelion didn't admit fault with the settlement. Johnson &amp; Johnson purchased Actelion in early 2017 for $30 billion. Authorities say the alleged conduct occurred before the J&amp;J buyout.

A J&amp;J representative said the company is "committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in our work to help patients get the medicines they need."

"Today's agreement resolves the government's investigation into Actelion's donations to a patient assistance foundation in 2014 and 2015," the spokeswoman added. "Before the company was acquired in 2017."

Actelion isn't the only company to face scrutiny for its charity contributions. Many industry players have disclosed investigations on the subject, and several have inked settlements to resolve allegations their payments served as kickbacks. Pfizer agreed to pay $23.8 million, and United Therapeutics' settlement amounted to $210 million.

Aside from those companies, Jazz and Lundbeck disclosed settlements worth $57 million and $52.6 million, respectively, Reutersreports.</content>

    <content type="text">The Department of Health and Human Services has named a new adviser to oversee its drug pricinginitiatives.

John O'Brien, a pharmacist and adviser to HHS Secretary Alex Azar on health reform and drug pricing policy, was named senior adviser for drug pricingreform,HHSannounced.He joinedHHS after serving as vice president of public policy at CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield. O'Brien also has a prior stint at the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services on his resume, HHS said.

âJohn O'Brien has already been an integral leader in HHS' efforts to bring down the high price of prescription drugs,â Azar said. âAs a senior adviser, he will carry forward the legacy of our departedcolleagueDan Best and build on the substantial progress that has already been made.â

RELATED:HHS touts work on drug prices 100 days after unveiling âAmerican Patients First' blueprint

Best, whowas tapped to lead the drug pricing policy effortsearlier this year,died last month.

Since the administration's drug pricing blueprint was unveiled in May, it has undertaken a slew of policies aimed atbringingdown the cost of drugs. HHS hasproposed changes in Medicare Part B and Part D, and is looking to force drug companies toput list prices of medications in their direct-to-consumer advertising.

O'Brien hit the ground running in his new role, and published a blog post on one of the agency's more controversial plans,the International Pricing Indexmodel, which aims to align the costs of drugs in Part B with the prices paid in other countries.

The plan also seeks to adjust the fees physicians earn on Part B drugs, and islikely to face provider pushback, particularly fromspecialtypractices like oncology.

RELATED:The âvendors' in HHS' new drug pricing plan sound an awful lot like PBMs, experts say

In the blog post, O'Brien said that the goal of the policy is to take on a âcrazy systemâ that lacks meaningful competition and encourages foreign free-loading.

The IPI model wouldn't stymie pharmaceutical innovation, asdrug companies have suggested, and wouldn't target programs that are already working in the market-based approach backed by the administration, O'Brien said.

The demonstration âprovides drug companies with a valid reason to walk away from the negotiating table when other countries demand low prices subsidized by American seniors,â he wrote. âThe socialist systems two whom drug companies are giving better deals simply do not have monopoly power when compared to the importance of participating in the Medicare program.â</content>

    <content type="text">WASHINGTON -- The growth of national health spending, which surged as millions of Americans gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act, slowed last year, the Trump administration said on Thursday.

Health spending in the United States totaled $3.5 trillion last year, up 3.9 percent from 2016, or about $10,740 a person. It accounted for 17.9 percent of the economy, officials said.

But the rate of increase for the major categories -- drugs, doctors and hospitals -- was more modest than in recent years. For the first time in several years, health spending grew at about the same rate as the economy as a whole in 2017. So the share of the economy devoted to health care stabilized. By contrast, over the past few decades, health spending has generally grown faster than the economy.

The 3.9 percent increase last year -- down from 4.8 percent in 2016 -- was the lowest since 2013.

''The relatively low rate of health spending growth in 2017 was similar to the average annual growth during 2008-13, which predated the major coverage expansions,'' said Anne B. Martin, an economist in the office of the actuary at the Department of Health and Human Services.

One factor that may have contributed to the slower growth in health spending is that the share of the population with health insurance fell slightly last year, Ms. Martin and her colleagues wrote in the journal Health Affairs. They did not explain the decline, although government surveys suggest a small reduction in the proportion of people who had public insurance coverage or private plans obtained through the insurance marketplace.

In addition, more people with insurance have high-deductible health plans, which tend to make them cost-conscious because they are personally responsible for a larger share of their medical costs.

Health spending grew rapidly in 2014 and 2015 because of the expansion of Medicaid and private insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, as well as the use of expensive but highly effective new drugs to treat hepatitis C.

The Affordable Care Act was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010, and the main provisions expanding coverage took effect in 2014.

Federal spending on health care shot up nearly 11 percent in 2014, mainly because of the expansion of Medicaid, but the growth has slowed every year since then, the report said. Federal spending on health care totaled nearly $1 trillion last year, and that does not count the huge tax subsidies for health care and coverage.

Spending on Medicaid, which now covers more than 70 million low-income people and is financed jointly by the federal government and the states, continued to grow in 2017, reaching a total of $582 billion, the report said. But the rate of growth slowed for the third straight year.

Medicaid spending -- the total of federal, state and local funds combined -- increased last year by 2.9 percent, following growth of 11.8 percent in 2014, then 9 percent in 2015 and 4.2 percent in 2016, the administration reported.

President Trump and Republicans in Congress tried last year to roll back the expansion of Medicaid, but ultimately failed.

Federal Medicaid payments increased less than 1 percent last year, following growth of 4.6 percent in 2016 and double-digit growth in 2014 and 2015.

Despite alarm over high drug prices, the administration reported that spending on prescription drugs at pharmacies, grocery stores and other retail outlets increased last year by just four-tenths of 1 percent, to $333 billion. That was the slowest growth since 2012, when many blockbuster drugs lost patent protection, driving down prices and total spending.

Those figures do not include spending on drugs in hospitals, where patients receive some of the most expensive drugs.

Declines in generic drug prices, lower price increases for existing brand-name drugs and a reduction in the number of prescriptions for pain medications contributed to the slower growth in drug spending last year, the administration said.

The growth of Medicare spending for hospital care also slowed last year, and federal officials said one reason was increased enrollment in private Medicare plans. Older Americans in these private Medicare Advantage plans ''tend to use more physician and less hospital services,'' compared with people in the original government-run Medicare program, the study in Health Affairs said.

More than one-third of the 60 million Medicare beneficiaries are in private plans, offered by companies like Humana and UnitedHealth.

Although the United States spends more on health care per person than any other country, the growth of spending here has slowed in the last decade.

''Health care spending growth averaged 4.3 percent per year during 2008-17, compared to an average annual rate of 7.3 percent over the 1998-2007 period,'' the report said.

Household spending on health care also slowed last year, increasing 3.8 percent after growth of 4.8 percent in 2016. The main reason, officials said, was slower growth in consumers' out-of-pocket spending, which includes co-payments, deductibles and payments for services not covered by insurance.

Out-of-pocket spending grew 2.6 percent last year, to $365.5 billion, which was slower than the 4.4 percent growth in 2016.</content>

    <content type="text">The drug maker Actelion Pharmaceuticals has agreed to a $360 million settlement stemming from an investigation into whether the company illegally funneled kickbacks through a patient-assistance charity, federal prosecutors said Thursday.

Actelion, which was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2017 and makes expensive drugs to treat a rare lung condition, is the latest pharmaceutical company to settle federal inquiries into their ties to patient-assistance groups, including whether companies have used the patient programs to increase the price of their drugs.

In 2017, United Therapeutics paid $210 million to settle similar allegations, and Pfizer paid nearly $24 million to do so in May. Several other drug makers have disclosed that they are also under investigation for their use of patient-assistance charities, including Biogen, Celgene and others. ''Pharmaceutical companies cannot have it both ways -- they cannot continue to increase drug prices while engaging in conduct designed to defeat the mechanisms that Congress designed to check such prices and then expect Medicare to pay for the ballooning costs,'' Joseph H. Hunt, an assistant attorney general for the Justice Department, said in a news release.

In 2014 and 2015, prosecutors said, Actelion raised the price of its main drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of inflation. Tracleer, which is prescribed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, sells in pharmacies for an average cash price of about $14,500 for 60 tablets, according to the website GoodRx.

Caroline Pavis, a spokeswoman for Actelion, said in a statement that the company was committed to complying with the law. It admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement. Johnson &amp; Johnson was not implicated in the allegations since the activity under scrutiny took place before Actelion was acquired.

Drug companies often help patients pay their out-of-pocket costs through coupons or other financial assistance. These payments are not just about benevolence -- they also help blunt the outrage over rising drug prices by limiting how much patients have to pay. Insurers then cover most of the cost.

But federal anti-kickback laws prohibit companies from giving such financial assistance to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries because doing so is considered an inducement to buy their drugs. For years, drug makers have skirted those laws by instead donating to nonprofit charities, which then give the money to Medicare patients. Such arrangements are legal as long as there is no direct coordination between the pharmaceutical company and the nonprofit organization.

Federal prosecutors said Actelion violated the law by collecting detailed data in 2014 and 2015 about the patients receiving help from a nonprofit, the Caring Voice Coalition, and using the data to budget for future donations. As a result, Actelion ensured that the money it donated would be used only to assist patients who used its drugs, and not competing companies' treatments for the pulmonary condition.

Prosecutors said Actelion kept up the practice even after the charity itself warned the company against it.

Actelion also steered Medicare patients to the Caring Voice Coalition who would have otherwise qualified financially for the company's free drug program. By directing them to the nonprofit, the company avoided having to provide the drug to eligible patients and left Medicare to cover the cost instead, prosecutors said.

Caring Voice Coalition no longer offers such programs. Last year, the federal government revoked its right to do so, citing concerns that it was coordinating too closely with drug companies.

The charity was also involved in the settlement with United Therapeutics, which, like Actelion, sells drugs that treat the same lung condition.

''We continue to help as many patients as we can navigate challenges within the health care system,'' Greg Smiley, the charity's chief executive, said in a statement. He said he could not comment on legal issues.

    <content type="text">SOUTH BEND - State Rep. Joe Taylor, D-South Bend, announced Monday that he'll resign from office to take a new job with the United Auto Workers International, just a month after narrowly winning re-election.

Taylor, an AM General worker and president of UAW Local 5, said the union approached him less than two months before the Nov. 6 election and let him know it was "interested" in him for the position. He said he told them he would think about it but at the time didn't want to withdraw from the race because he didn't want to risk Democrats losing the seat. "As a lifelong Democrat, I think my job first and foremost was to keep the seat in the party's hands," Taylor said. "Anything after that was an afterthought."

In one of the election's closest races, Taylor beat Republican Troy Dillon, a welder/fabricator and Donald Trump fan from North Liberty, by just 715 votes. The margin was so close that some people were telling Dillon he had won when he went to bed on election night.

A week after the election, Taylor said UAW International officials called him to see if he was still interested in the new job. He interviewed for the position at the union's regional office in Indianapolis on the morning of Nov. 20, the legislature's Organization Day, and then was sworn into office in the afternoon.

Taylor said he knew it was a "good possibility" he wouldn't be able to serve the two-year Statehouse term if he landed the new servicing representative position, in which he visits UAW plants and helps locals with contract negotiations, arbitration and employee disciplinary matters. Once he finishes training, he will learn his territory, but he could be required to move out of Indiana, he said.

"Had I known about this in April, or even after the (May) primary, I would have pulled myself out of the way," he said. "I never knew I'd be considered."

Taylor, a 42-year-old married father of six whose wife also works at AM General, said the new salaried union position offers him more pay and better retirement benefits than his hourly job.

"This new position provides a life-changing opportunity for me to provide for my family, and I simply could not pass it up," he said.

Dillon said he understands Taylor's desire to take a job that will improve things for his family but he thinks it was "misleading" not to not tell voters before the election that he was considering it.

"Now we're going to have somebody handpicked by a handful of precinct committee people to represent the southern half of St. Joe County, which means all these voters had no say-so in this," said Dillon, who plans to run again in two years. "So 23,000 votes for state rep for southern St. Joe County, aren't they just kind of thrown out? It just doesn't make sense to me."

Taylor won his first term two years ago, representing the 7th District, which covers urban areas on South Bend's west side and Mishawaka's south side, along with rural areas that include Walkerton, North Liberty and Lakeville. During his term, he focused on workers' rights, addressing the needs of veterans, requiring transparency for the cost of prescription drugs, and helping students stay on track to graduate, the statement said.

Indiana Democratic Party chairman John Zody has 30 days to convene a caucus of precinct committee chairs from throughout the district, of which there are about 40, said Jason Critchlow, county party chair. Critchlow said Zody wants to seat Taylor's successor as soon as possible so that he can "hit the ground running" when the General Assembly starts Jan. 3.

"We're really disappointed and sad to see Joe go but we completely understand the difficult decision he had to make for him and his family," Critchlow said. "There's been no finer public servant than Joe Taylor and we're proud of the job he's done."

Critchlow noted in tweets Monday that the deadline to withdraw from the General Election ballot was July 16, and absentee ballots were printed and mailed by early September - before Taylor said the union approached him about the new job.

County Republican Party Chair Lynn Fitzpatrick said she understands Critchlow's point about those dates, and, like Dillon, she doesn't fault Taylor for accepting the job opportunity.

"I just feel like voters had the right to know," she said.</content>

    <content type="text">CARE Ratings revised the ratings on certain bank facilities of
Vivimed Labs Ltd, as:
Â 
                     Amount
   Facilities      (INR crore)     Ratings
   ----------      -----------     -------
   Long-term Bank      266.93      CARE D Revised from CARE BB; Facilities                      Stable
Â 
   Short-term Bank     109.50      CARE D Revised from CARE A4
   Facilities
Â 
Detailed Rationale &amp; Key Rating Drivers
Â 
The revision in the ratings assigned to the bank facilities of
Vivimed Labs Ltd is primarily of account of deterioration in the
liquidity profile of the company at the back of cash flow
mismatches resulting in delays in meeting debt obligations. CARE
in its analysis has considered the consolidated business and
financial risk profiles of Vivimed Labs Limited and its
subsidiaries viz., Vivimed Life Sciences Private Ltd, Vivimed
Global Generics Pte. Ltd, Vivimed Speciality Chemicals Pvt. Ltd,
Vivimed Labs Europe Ltd, Vivimed Labs USA Inc, Vivimed Labs
Mauritius Ltd, Vivimed Labs UK Ltd, Vivimed Labs Spain S.L, Union
Quimico Farmaceutical S.A.U, Holiday International Ltd, Uquifa
Mexico S.A DE C.V, Creative Healthcare Private Ltd, Klarsehen
Private Ltd, Finoso Pharma Private Ltd as these entities are
linked through parent-subsidiary relationship and collectively
have management, business &amp; financial linkages.
Â 
Detailed description of the key rating drivers
Â 
Key rating weakness
Â 
Deterioration in the liquidity profile resulting in delays in
meeting debt obligations: The liquidity profile of VLL
deteriorated on account of cash flow mismatches. The same has
resulted in delays with respect to debt servicing of the company.
Â 
Decline in consolidated revenues and cash accruals during FY18:
The total operating income of the company at consolidated level
has deteriorated marginally by 4% from INR1238.99 crore in FY17
to INR1195.27 crore in FY18 primarily due to decline in the
revenue from specialty chemical division. The PAT and GCA of the
company during FY18 are on a lower side vis-a-vis FY17, primarily
on account of additional extraordinary income of around INR237
crore received by the company from sale of a unit and certain
spec chem. products to Clariant during Q4FY17. Further, the
company has registered operating income of around INR364.29 crore
in Q1FY19.
Â 
Elongated operating cycle: The operating cycle of the company
remains elongated at 191 days for FY17 as against 181 days for
FY16 primarily on account of high inventory period. The average
inventory period has increased from 151 days in FY16 to 168 days
in FY17, however the absolute inventory level has remained almost
stable at INR483.97 crore as on March 31, 2017 as against INR
490.80 crore as on March 31, 2016. On account of large product
portfolio, considerable proportion of exports and longer work in
progress time, the company needs to maintain the finished goods
stock of multiple products at its plant which leads to higher
inventory period. The average working capital utilization of the
company for the 12 months ended September 2017 was around 86%.
Â 
Foreign exchange fluctuation risk: Substantial portion of VLL's
(consolidated) sales revenue is the form of exports. Exports
generally at standalone level constitute around 50-60% of the
company's sales. The company has also exposure of foreign
currency loans. Therefore, the company is subjected to the risk
on account of foreign exchange fluctuations.
Â 
Exposure to regulatory risk: The company is exposed to regulatory
risk as in India; the prices of pharmaceutical products are
regulated by government through the drug price control order
(DPCO) under price control mechanism. Besides, the pharmaceutical
industry is highly regulated in many other countries and requires
various approvals, licenses, registrations and permissions for
business activities. The approval process for a new product
registration is complex, lengthy and expensive.
Â 
Intense Competition: The company faces intense competition in the
domestic as well as international markets. Pricing pressure,
increasing regulation, increased sensitivity towards product
performance are the key issues in the pharmaceutical industry.
The
pharmaceutical industry has been a highly regulated industry
worldwide by virtue of its direct bearing on public health. In
India too, government policies have played a key role in
performance of companies such as explicit control on drug prices
in the form of drug price control order (DPCO). Furthermore, the
patent laws and related regulations might hamper company's plans
to launch new products and cater to new markets.
Â 
Key rating strengths
Â 
Improved Operating margin during FY18: Excluding the
extraordinary income, the PBILDT, PAT and profitability margins
of the company during FY18 witnessed improvement vis-a-vis FY17.
The PBILDT margin of the company has improved by 407 bps from
14.47% in FY17 to 18.54% in FY18. However, the PAT margin has
declined from 17.90% in FY17 to 6.52% in FY18, as FY17 PAT
includes the extraordinary income. Further, during Q1FY19, PBILDT
margin of the company is 20.46% and PAT margin was 7.86%.
Â 
Experienced &amp; qualified promoters and management team: The
promoters of VLL have over two decades of experience in the
pharmaceutical and chemical business. Mr. Santosh Varalwar (CEO&amp;
MD), a management graduate, is mainly responsible for developing
new markets for the company's products. VLL's board is supported
by a team of professionals in the areas of finance, marketing,
quality control, R&amp;D, material and production.
Â 
Track record of operations with a unique diversified portfolio of
Pharmaceutical products and Speciality Chemicals: VLL,
established in 1988, is a global player engaged in manufacturing
of speciality chemicals and pharmaceutical products. The company
has 11 manufacturing facilities and 5 R&amp;D facilities spread
across the world. Historically, Speciality Chemical segment was
VLL's main revenue contributor. For FY17, pharmaceutical segment
accounted 68% of gross sales of FY17, while specialty chemical
segment contributed the balance 32%.
Â 
Infusion of funds by Orbimed Asia and Strides resulting in
improved capital structure: VLL in order to have a strong
footprint in United States (US) has entered into a JV agreement
in May 2017, with Strides Shasun Ltd for investment of INR75
crore in its subsidiaries Vivimed Life Sciences Pvt Ltd (VLSPL)
and Vivimed Global Generics Pte Ltd. During H1FY18, OrbiMed Asia
has invested USD 42.50 million (Rs.278 crore) in the form of
Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) in VLL's
subsidiary, Vivimed Labs Mascarene Ltd which is the holding
entity of VLL's API business, UQUlFA as per the definitive
agreement.
Â 
The overall gearing of the company on consolidated level improved
to 0.70x as on March 31, 2018 as against 1.48x as on March 31,
2017 at the back of equity infusion, repayment of term debt and
plough back of profits.
Â 
Unique diversified portfolio of Pharmaceutical products and
Speciality Chemicals with strong R&amp;D capabilities: VLL has 11
manufacturing facilities and 5 R&amp;D facilities spread across the
world. VLL manufactures over 50 APIs covering over 15+
therapeutic segments at its three international USFDA facilities
in Uquifa Spain and Mexico.Company has exhibited strong R&amp;D over
the years. The company has 5 ANDA approvals and 150+ Drug Master
Files as on September 30, 2017 Further, the company is actively
working on 10-12 new products (Formulations) which are set to go
off patent from 2018 onwards and are in different stages of
filing and are expected to get commercialized over the next 24-36
months.
Â 
During FY17, VLL has received ANDA approvals for five products of
which the company commercialized four namely Losartan
(Antihypertensive- Therapeutic segment), Amlodipine
Antihypertensive- Therapeutic segment and Metronidazole
(Antibiotics- Therapeutic Segment) and Donepezil (Anti-Alzheimer-
Therapeutic segment). The fifth product (Zolpidem- Hypnotic -
Therapeutic segment) is expected to be launched in the FY19. The
aforementioned products with good market size help the company in
increasing the revenue going forward.
Â 
Incorporated in 1988, Vivimed Labs Limited (VLL) is a listed
company engaged in the business of manufacturing products (active
ingredients, formulations, etc) for pharmaceutical, personal care
and colour chemistry industry. VLL (Consolidated) has
manufacturing facilities in India and overseas (under
subsidiaries). During FY16, VLL divested a part of its Specialty
Chemical business (comprising Home and Personal Care segments) to
Clariant India Limited for INR380 crore. Further, during FY16,
the company has received sanctions from courts for the scheme of
Amalgamation which provides for the amalgamation of the wholly
owned subsidiaries of the company viz., Creative Health Care
Private Limited, Octtantis Nobel Labs Private Limited, KlarSehen
Private Limited and Vivimed Labs (Alathur) Private Limited.</content>

    <content type="text">Incretins are a group of metabolic hormones that stimulate on the decrease in blood glucose levels. Incretin-based drugs include dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, which are a relatively new group of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These drugs are associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia and have the favorable effect on body weight. Oral anti-diabetic drugs fail to maintain the desired normal levels of glucose, particularly during postprandial conditions, this has resulted in a strong need for better therapeutics like incretin-based drugs. Incretin-based drugs increase the secretion of insulin by acting on pancreatic beta cells and also inhibits the release of glucagon by acting on the pancreatic alpha cells. Incretin-based drugs namely Incretin mimetics (GLP-1 agonist) and DPP-4 inhibitors work on the antidiabetic principle of incretin hormone.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors By formulation, the incretin-based drugs market can be segmented into,

Oral Drugs Injectable Drugs By distribution channel, the incretin-based drugs market can be segmented into,

Hospital Pharmacies Retail Pharmacies Online Pharmacies Others Several large cohorts of patients with diabetes, the use of incretin-based drugs as compared with combinations of oral antidiabetic drugs were not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure.

Incretin-Based Drugs Market: Overview

Approximately 26 million diabetic patients in the United States and 35 million in the European Union alone is growing prevalence of diabetes worldwide posing a major public health challenge. Both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are committed to ensuring the safety of drug products marketed for the treatment of diabetes and post marketing reports of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in patients taking certain antidiabetic medications like incretin-based drugs. Working in parallel, these agencies have reviewed epidemiologic data, clinical trial data and nonclinical toxicology studies related to blood glucose lowering drug products like exenatide and sitagliptin which are incretin-based drugs that stimulate postprandial insulin release by potentiating the incretin hormone pathways. The results highlighted that these incretin-based drugs reduce body weight and have better cardiovascular outcomes.

Incretin-Based Drugs Market: Region-wise Outlook

Regionally, the market can be segmented into North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Asia-Pacific excluding Japan, Japan, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. Global demand for incretin-based drugs is anticipated to be influenced by favorable government policies. Governments in many countries are taking steps to subsidize diabetes drugs so that economically weaker sections of the society have access to quality healthcare. Technological innovation in the development of drugs is also expected to provide an impetus to the growth of the market. Availability of rapid acting and long acting insulin analogs is emerging as an effective way of managing both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for incretin-based drugs is increasing in Asia-Pacific, whereas North America and Western Europe are lucrative markets for incretin-based drugs owing to increasing awareness on diabetes diagnosis and management.

    <content type="text">Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill announced on Dec. 3 his office is leading a 12-state federal lawsuit against a Fort Wayne web-based electronic health records company that allegedly sustained a data breach compromising the data of more than 3.9 million people. 

The lawsuit alleges that Medical Informatics Engineering Inc. and NoMoreClipboard LLC (collectively known as MIE) violated provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act as well as state claims including unfair and deceptive practice laws, notice of data breach statutes and state personal information protection acts, according to the statement. 

Between May 7 and May 26, 2015, hackers infiltrated WebChart, a web application run by MIE. The hackers stole the electronic information of more than 3.9 million individuals. 
     
This information included individual names, telephone numbers, mailing addresses, usernames, hashed passwords, security questions and answers, spousal information (name and potentially dates of birth), email addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, lab results, health insurance policy information, diagnosis, disability codes, doctorsâ names, medical conditions and childrenâs names and birth statistics, according to the statement. 

This filing marks the first time state attorneys general have joined together to pursue a HIPAA-related data breach case in federal court. 
Tapestry scholarship opportunities expand 
Purdue University Fort Wayne and Parkview Health announced an expansion of scholarship opportunities through Tapestry with an increase in the number of academic programs with eligible students in 2019. 

Tapestry began in 2002 as a way to enrich the lives of women in northeast Indiana and raise money for scholarships for students at the Fort Wayne campus. This mission continues today with the goal of providing a day of inspiration, renewal and education for women in all stages of life, according to a statement. 

âParkview Health is proud to be the exclusive partner with Purdue Fort Wayne for Tapestry and to provide students across the region the opportunity for scholarships,â Dena Jacquay , chief human resources officer at Parkview said in the statement. 
     
Scholarships will now benefit students in select academic programs at both PFW and Indiana University Fort Wayne , which formally became separate entities in July 2018. 

âWe are thrilled that we can expand this partnership,â Kathleen Jackson , PFW Tapestry project manager said in the statement. âWe now have the opportunity to offer these scholarships to students in even more of our academic programs, and that is really exciting to us.â 

Since 2002, nearly $1 million has been raised through Tapestry. The Tapestry Parkview endowment has grown to more than $600,000 and 89 students have received scholarships. 

Tapestry is scheduled for May 3, 2019, at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum. 
Visiting Nurse to host planning workshop      
Visiting Nurse is hosting a free workshop to help community members plan for the event of becoming sick or chronically ill. The event is scheduled for 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. on Dec. 11 at the Visiting Nurse Peggy F. Murphy Community Grief Center at 5920 Homestead Road in Fort Wayne. 

Attendees will learn what documents are needed by first responders, their medical team and their loved ones should they become unable to speak for themselves. Attendees will determine what is an important paper, learn how to gather their information and receive their own personal information log. 

Katie Hougham from Aging and In-Home Services will also provide information on advance care planning and where to find additional helpful documents for individuals and families in need. Those interested in attending this presentation are asked to RSVP to Cassandra Rosene by calling (260) 435-3205. 
Lawmakers call for VA investigation 
Sen. Todd Young , R-Ind., and Sen. Brian Schatz , D-Hawaii, Sen. John Boozman , R-Ark. and a bipartisan group of ten additional lawmakers have called for a Department of Veterans Affairs Inspector General investigation into allegations that the VA would not reimburse veterans for missed or underpaid benefits. 

In a bipartisan letter to the VA inspector general, the lawmakers asked about how the technical errors occurred, how quickly any reimbursements will be made and how the VA plans to make sure all benefits will continue to be paid out without interruption, according to a statement. 
 
âThe VAâs continued ambiguity about whether it will fulfill this legal requirement threatens to erode our veteransâ confidence in the VAâs ability to deliver promised care and benefits and demands close oversight and accountability,â the lawmakers wrote in the statement. âIt is important that VA fix the technical and staffing shortages that contributed to its inability to implement the Forever GI bill so that it can continue to provide housing stipends to veterans.â 
AG coalition defends right to regulate drug cost 
Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill this month joined a bipartisan coalition of 32 attorneys general in filing an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court supporting statesâ rights to regulate and address the rising cost of prescription drugs. 

In Rutledge versus Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the coalition argues states must retain the right to regulate pharmacy benefit managers to protect consumers. PBMs act as gatekeepers among pharmacies, drug manufacturers, health insurance plans and consumers for access to prescription drugs, according to a statement. 

A 2015 Arkansas law regulating PBMs was challenged by the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which argued that the Employment Retirement Income Security Act prevents the state of Arkansas from implementing the law. Arkansas has asked the Supreme Court to hear the case. 

In this monthâs filing, the attorneys general argue that state laws regulating pharmacy benefit managers are not restricted by federal law. They argue regulation is critical to the statesâ ability to improve the transparency of prescription drug marketplaces and to protect consumersâ access to affordable prescription drugs, especially those in underserved, rural and isolated communities, according to the statement.</content>

    <content type="text">That finding is according to an article [ Martin et al. 2018 ] by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicesâ (CMS) Office of the Actuaryâs (OACT). 
 
Total nominal US health care spending increased 3.9Â percent to $3.5Â trillion in 2017, slowing from growth of 4.8Â percent in 2016..Slower growth in health care spending in 2017 was mainly attributable to the use and intensity of goods and services, particularly for hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs. Nearly all major sources of insurance and sponsors of health care experienced slower growth in 2017. On a per capita basis, spending on health careâ¦reached $10,739 in 2017. The share of gross domestic product devoted to health care spending was 17.9Â percent in 2017, similar to the share in 2016. 
 
While healthcare utilization decelerated, prices continued to increase.Â Â Medical price growth accelerated from 1.3% in 2016 to 1.6% in 2017. 
 
Note that Medicaid spending growth was slower than commercial or Medicare. Further, prescription drug pricesâoften demonized in the popular pressâonly rose by 0.4% compared to the prior year.</content>

    <content type="text">A rare point of consensus following the midterm elections is that Americans are adamant about lowering drug prices. Bipartisan pledges to seek common ground on this vexing issue suggest we might finally see action to make medicines more affordable. 

What should this new common ground look like? Beyond important proposals like allowing drug importation or Medicare negotiation, policymakers should take a hard look at one of the key factors affecting market competition, transparency, and affordability: patents. 

Patent abuse by drug makers is one of the most influential drivers of our pricing problem. U.S. law provides 20 years of patent exclusivity for inventions such as a new medicine â meaning two decades that a drug maker has monopoly power to develop a medicine and set prices however they wish. Even if it takes eight years to develop a medicine, that leaves 12 years for the drug to have market exclusivity. 

While rewarding invention is important, under the U.S. patent system those rewards have become inflated and unmerited as drug makers have developed defensive strategies that include overly broad patent claims and filing large numbers of follow-on or secondary patents to extend their monopolies. Patients are paying the price. 

Diabetes provides a good snapshot of the problem. Approximately 7 million Americans rely on insulin to live. Surging insulin prices have gotten so out of hand that 1 in 4 Americans are rationing their own treatment , putting their lives in jeopardy and, in some cases, dying . 

Without insurance, one five-pen carton of Lantus Solostar costs $280 at all major pharmacies in the U.S. The exact same branded â not generic â package costs about $50 in a leading diabetes clinic in Mexico . 

Lantus, made by Sanofi, is the leading drug for people with type 1 diabetes. The company makes $15 million every day selling this type of insulin. 

As shown in a new report from I-MAK, the organization I help direct, the price of Lantus jumped 18 percent each year from 2012-2016. During that time, U.S. taxpayers bought more than $22 billion worth of Lantus through Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, Lantus ranked number two for total overall expenditure in 2016 for both Medicare and Medicaid. 

Lantus is also highly overpatented . Though Sanofiâs primary patents on Lantus expired in 2015, the company has filed 70 secondary patent applications in the U.S. â 95 percent of its total â since the drug was first approved and put on the market in 2000. If granted, these additional patents would give Sanofi monopoly protection for up to 37 more years â almost double the duration provided under U.S. law. 

Why would a pharmaceutical company file so many patents after a drug is already on the market? Quite simply to preserve and extend its ability to keep competition at bay while hiking prices. 

The company â which along with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk control nearly the entire U.S. insulin market â has further prevented insulin competition in America by pursuing litigation against two companies that want to offer cheaper biosimilars. (Biosimilars are the generic-like equivalents for complex molecules such as insulin and other biologic drugs.) Like overpatenting, this tactic works against the millions of Americans who must take insulin. 

Putting two or more generics on the market has been shown to drastically reduce drug prices. In Europe and Japan, fewer patent applications and more friendly biosimilar regulatory requirements have led to multiple biosimilar competitors of Lantus, helping drive down prices and improve access to treatment. 

Gestures like Sanofiâs recently expanded patient assistance programs offer savings to struggling patients. But Americans in need of treatment should not have to jump through hoops for medicine that ought to be affordable in the first place. Put another way, âI shouldnât have to go beg for my insulin. It should be affordable to me,â Myranda Pierce, a graduate student at Boston University School of Medicine who has type 1 diabetes, told STAT . 

Unfortunately, the mix of patent thickets , prolonged exclusivity, delayed competition, and jacked-up prices is typical of Americaâs best-selling medications. Overpatenting is so pervasive that a new report from the bipartisan Congressional Diabetes Caucus calls for outlawing âevergreening,â and also proposes other patent reforms because such practices block competition and prevent affordable generics from reaching Americans. 

To get patent reform right, policymakers should not only stop evergreening and pay-for-delay agreements that keep generic alternatives off the market. They must also remember whatâs at the core of a patent: invention. To deserve the title âpatentâ â and the reward of exclusivity that comes with it â a discovery must be truly inventive, not just an incremental improvement. 

Unfortunately, the current patent system too often forgets the inventive part of patent law and hands out 20-year monopolies for âimprovementsâ based on routinely practiced science â whether thatâs putting three pills into one pill to improve adherence or making a slight adjustment to the dosage formulation, as Sanofi claimed in one of its later patents on Lantus. To provide real incentives to help companies usher in the next medical breakthroughs, we need to raise the bar for what is deemed inventive under patent law. If we donât, we should no longer call it a patent system but a monopoly-handout-in-return-for-an-investment system. 

As cited in the I-MAK report on Lantus, Erin Little, an entrepreneur in Kansas City, Mo., told T1International, âNo one I know can afford this drug without assistance, and patient assistance programs, if you even qualify, eventually run out. I had to pay $1,000 for a monthâs supply of Lantus before I found a way to get the same version in Mexico for just $100. Itâs not right. Drug companies are squeezing us for every possible penny. Itâs forcing people to ration drugs and putting lives at risk.â 

Americans deserve better. Thatâs why Minnesotaâs attorney general recently sued the big three insulin makers for price gouging the U.S., why the American Medical Association has called for federal interventions on insulin pricing, and why thereâs a lot riding on the next Congress to rein in rising drug costs. 

As part of the solution, patent reform can help boost competition and transparency and stop companies from dictating sticker-shock prices. There are too many stories of agonized patients struggling to afford treatment, forced to ration their medicine, and left to absorb the cost of high drug prices with their very own bodies.

    <content type="text">W ASHINGTON â Forget the push to bring more generics to market or to tweak Medicareâs arcane payment system. 

Democrats, newly empowered in D.C. and on the hunt for bigger and bolder ways to lower drug prices, are suddenly taking aim at a far more central part of pharmaâs monopoly power: the patents the industry holds on its drugs. 

For years, lawmakers from both parties have shied away to address the industryâs intellectual property. Muck with a drug companyâs government-granted monopoly, the thinking goes, and investments in research and development will disappear. Pharma even helped to scuttle a broad, bipartisan patent reform effort in 2015, in part because the industry worried that even small changes focused on bad actors would open the door to bigger ones. 

Now, however, after a midterm election season that saw voters more focused on drug prices than ever before, progressives are decrying the intellectual property monopolies that give pharma the ability to charge exorbitant prices â and threatening legislative action. 

They are doing so with a three-pronged attack, one element of which is a new proposal: language that has appeared in two major drug-pricing bills introduced in recent months that would enable âcompulsory licensingâ â allowing the health secretary to break a monopoly by issuing a license to a competitor if negotiations stall. A second came when presumptive House speaker Nancy Pelosi made a high-profile nod this summer to a law that enables the government to seize patents in extreme circumstances. A third would pressure the National Institutes of Health to reinterpret laws governing how it transfers federally funded inventions to the private sector â a role the agency itself does not want. 

The new bills, to numerous Capitol Hill aides and outside drug policy experts, typify an emboldened Democratic presence in Washington, following a campaign-trail focus on health care costs â and drug prices in particular â that paid dividends in November. 

âWhen you look at the new bills, theyâre designed to deal specifically with the problem of high drug prices,â said Rachel Sachs, a law professor at Washington University who focuses on patent law and the health industry. âItâs more interesting and detailed proposals than weâve seen before.â 

While legislation that could end drug company monopolies is unlikely to become law, drug industry opponents see the fact that such conversations are being had publicly as a victory within itself. The renewed enthusiasm, Democrats say, could serve as penance for what they view as years of bad-faith negotiation. 

Itâs not just Democrats. In August, the National Governors Association â a group representing governors from both major political parties â endorsed a âcompulsory licensingâ proposal akin to language in the two pieces of federal legislation, one from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), and the other from Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas). 

Those bills either use international reference prices to cap U.S. payments for drugs or allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Each would allow the health secretary to issue a second license to a competitor company if those negotiations end in a stalemate. 

Pelosiâs threat to PhRMA, meanwhile, centered on an existing law once used to threaten the drug company Cipro at the height of the anthrax scare in the early 2000s. It allows the health secretary to seize a patent for government use when necessary. 

A third, long-touted concept would pressure the NIH to re-interpret the Bayh-Dole Act, which governs intellectual property developed using federal research, and âmarch inâ on licenses for drugs that were excessively priced by their manufacturer. 

Republicans â and brand-name drug manufacturers with them â say itâs easy to understand the patent-focused proposalsâ political appeal, especially compared to more technical proposals regarding rebates or insurance issues. But while Democrats have found it easy to explain some drug companiesâ monopolistic behavior in laymanâs terms, Republicans and industry figures alike fear bills like Doggettâs would prove a death knell for new cures. 

âThatâs a great way to kill venture-capital investment in a new Alzheimerâs drug,â said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), at a STAT event last week. âIf you start marching in, saying we donât care what your [intellectual property] is, weâre going to now take it over, VC is going to evaporate.â 

Joe Grogan, a top drug pricing adviser to the Trump administration, said the federal government exercising its march-in rights would be a âdisaster,â likening such proposals to theft. 

âBy overriding the intellectual property protections for a product, compulsory licensing breaks the governmentâs word to the inventor that their product is protected for a set period of time,â said PhRMA spokeswoman Holly Campbell, âcreating significant uncertainty and discouraging future innovation.â 

Democratsâ response is twofold. For one, aides who have worked on drug-pricing legislation told STAT they are tired of drug companies responding to every policy proposal by claiming it will mark the end of new drug development. Even health secretary Alex Azar, a former Eli Lilly executive and Trump appointee, has refuted that talking point in his agencyâs policy rollouts. 

Additionally, to signal their belief that exclusive licenses cannot exist in eternity, both parties are highlighting drug manufacturersâ aggressive âevergreeningâ and âpay-for-delayâ tactics. Even the FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, a Trump appointee, has made such practices a focus of his own agencyâs work to tackle drug costs. 



The new Democratic legislation is noteworthy, in large part, because it moves beyond bellyaching about the current and broad patent law landscape and instead proposes new mechanisms for the federal government. 

Progressive lawmakers say that, in their view, drug industry patent abuse has reached a crisis level â and that political momentum to tackle drug prices has set the stage for a particularly aggressive push on intellectual property issues. 

âMarket exclusivity is a privilege,â said Khanna, who joined Sanders on his legislation on the issue. âWhen you abuse that by price-gouging the sick and aging, then you lose that privilege.â 

In the past, Democrats had focused more on existing law, including a push for the NIH to re-interpret laws governing intellectual property to factor in high drug costs. James Love, the director of the intellectual-property-focused nonprofit Knowledge Ecology International, suggested lawmakers had been âpretendingâ they didnât need new legislation to address abuses of the patent system â and that the NIH might be able to take care of the problem itself. 

That interpretation, however, could put the NIH in the difficult position of regulating drug costs when it issues licenses to commercialize federal research and in the years that follow. 

Bayh-Dole, the current framework governing patents derived from federal research, allows for new licenses to be granted to address a health or safety need. The NIH has never used law has never been used to âmarch inâ â to grant a competitor the right to manufacture a drug initially developed and patented by another company â despite six petitions requesting the NIH do so, many on the basis of a drugâs high cost. 

Advocates argue thereâs already a clear health or safety need, given that millions of Americans struggle to afford medicines. Democratsâ increasing interest in âmarch-inâ rights, however, has at times pulled the NIH into an unwanted spotlight. 

âOur role at NIH is not to control drug prices,â said Mark Rohrbaugh, the special adviser for technology transfer at NIH. âIf we tried to, as was our experience in a limited way in the early- and mid-1990s, the products donât get developed. Nobodyâs interested in them because they donât want to be subject to some kind of government price control.â 

Other figures familiar with federal research expressed concern that the NIH being forced to police high drug costs could turn a beloved research agency into a politicized regulatory body. Kathy Hudson, the agencyâs former deputy director of science, outreach, and policy, said that NIH figures agree on the need to lower drug costs, but see the issue as both beyond their scope. 

âThe bottom line is that NIH is poorly equipped to be in the business of figuring out prices,â she said. âItâs ironic that Congress is saying, âYou should go figure this out,â because maybe itâs Congress that needs to.â 

As Rohrbaugh described, the agency in the mid-1990s attempted to implement a âreasonable pricingâ clause that bound drug companies to set accessible prices for drugs developed in collaboration with NIH. 

âAn extensive review of this matter over the past year indicated that the pricing clause has driven industry away from potentially beneficial scientific collaborations,â Harold Varmus, then the NIH director, wrote in 1995. With the policy lifted, new collaborations tripled. 

Even then, Democratic lawmakers â including then-Rep. Ron Wyden (Ore.), now the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee â warned that government could step back in if prices were to balloon. 

Even in a best-case scenario for advocates of reclaiming intellectual property, such march-ins will likely never happen: Most analysis shows that even if government was empowered to break monopolies if bulk-pricing deals couldnât be struck, companies would be driven to the negotiating table to avoid losing their market exclusivity. 

In Democratsâ view, that scenario is a win-win â either drug companies would negotiate a reasonable cost with government, or their monopolies would be broken. Conservative concerns that a bargaining stalemate would effectively deny patients access, one aide said, are nullified by the new competitorâs ability to step in and manufacture the drug in question. 

While Rohrbaugh declined to speculate as to the circumstances that would lead the NIH to break a monopoly, he did not rule out a scenario in which cost proved such an immense obstacle to access that the agency would feel compelled to act. From the NIHâs perspective, however, regularly breaking monopolies for the sake of lowering drug costs would soon backfire. 

âIt would not become a regular practice,â Rohrbaugh said, âbecause the drugs just wouldnât get developed.â</content>

    <content type="text">Bigger Pharmaceutical Imports Help Bring U.S. Trade Deficit To AÂ Record Chinaâs Retaliatory Trade Tariffs Seem To Be Having An Impact; Trumpâs Not SoÂ Much Eric J Scholl Blocked Unblock Follow Following Dec 6 
Notice when you get your prescription filled at the drug store these days, itâs extremely likelyâââespecially if you take genericsâââthe label lists a manufacturer based overseas? Two or three years ago most of those generic manufacturers were based in India. Now an increasing number are in China . The Food and Drug Administration has offices in both those countries. Even so, the number of warning letters from the FDA to foreign producers have been growing every year, with China leading the way. 

And it presents a unique problem for Trump: heâs promised to get drug prices down while at the same time pledging more drugs will be made in the U.S.A. for safety reasons . But even brand name drugs that are made in the U.S. by U.S. companies source 80% of their ingredients from India and China . Overall, drugs sold by U.S. distributors of overseas manufacturers are creeping toward 20%. So this seems like a really hard high wire act Trumpâs set out for himself. And in fact Trumpâs USMCA (or the new NAFTA) that he just signed and now has to get through Congress, allows drug manufacturers more time before cheaper generics are introduced. If it passes, big pharma will now have a full decade before their products face generic competition. 

Overall, Americaâs trade deficit soared to $55.5-billion according to the most recent numbers available from the Commerce Department, which are from October. Thatâs the biggest monthly deficit in 10 years. Itâs not all bad news: the U.S. actually ran a surplus globally on services, like banking, tourism and insurance. But Trumpâs very manufacturing-focused, and often only includes goods, not services, in the figures he tosses around, and then he tends to exaggerate on top of it. Also, the U.S. exported a record amount of energy products . 

The U.S. trade surplus with China soared more than 7% to a record $43.1-billion, partly due to that $1.5-billion increase in pharmaceuticals, but also a lot of consumer goods. And thatâs all despite Trump having slapped tariffs on a wide range of goods. Part of the reason Trumpâs tariffs arenât having the âdesiredâ effect is the dollar is strong. And as weâve said before, if you slap a 20% tariff on some imported product, but the dollar rises 10%, the effectiveness of your tariff is cut in half. 

Meanwhile, retaliatory tariffs by China do seem to be hurting the U.S. Soybean exports suffered a dramatic plunge of nearly 50%. That was one of the first areas China targeted, and according to Bloomberg is one of the first areas itâs considering opening back up following Trumpâs purported trade entente with Chinaâs President Xi last weekend. 

While less than 40% of the deficit with China, the U.S. trade deficit with Europe surged even more in percentage terms, rising 65.5%, also to a new record. And Trump hasnât even gotten started on Europe â¦</content>

    <content type="text">A rare point of consensus following the midterm elections is that Americans are adamant about lowering drug prices. Bipartisan pledges to seek common ground on this vexing issue suggest we might finally see action to make medicines more affordable. 

What should this new common ground look like? Beyond important proposals like allowing drug importation or Medicare negotiation, policymakers should take a hard look at one of the key factors affecting market competition, transparency, and affordability: patents. 

Patent abuse by drug makers is one of the most influential drivers of our pricing problem. U.S. law provides 20 years of patent exclusivity for inventions such as a new medicine â meaning two decades that a drug maker has monopoly power to develop a medicine and set prices however they wish. Even if it takes eight years to develop a medicine, that leaves 12 years for the drug to have market exclusivity. 

While rewarding invention is important, under the U.S. patent system those rewards have become inflated and unmerited as drug makers have developed defensive strategies that include overly broad patent claims and filing large numbers of follow-on or secondary patents to extend their monopolies. Patients are paying the price. 

Diabetes provides a good snapshot of the problem. Approximately 7 million Americans rely on insulin to live. Surging insulin prices have gotten so out of hand that 1 in 4 Americans are rationing their own treatment , putting their lives in jeopardy and, in some cases, dying . 

Without insurance, one five-pen carton of Lantus Solostar costs $280 at all major pharmacies in the U.S. The exact same branded â not generic â package costs about $50 in a leading diabetes clinic in Mexico . 

Lantus, made by Sanofi, is the leading drug for people with type 1 diabetes. The company makes $15 million every day selling this type of insulin. 

As shown in a new report from I-MAK, the organization I help direct, the price of Lantus jumped 18 percent each year from 2012-2016. During that time, U.S. taxpayers bought more than $22 billion worth of Lantus through Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, Lantus ranked number two for total overall expenditure in 2016 for both Medicare and Medicaid. 

Lantus is also highly overpatented . Though Sanofiâs primary patents on Lantus expired in 2015, the company has filed 70 secondary patent applications in the U.S. â 95 percent of its total â since the drug was first approved and put on the market in 2000. If granted, these additional patents would give Sanofi monopoly protection for up to 37 more years â almost double the duration provided under U.S. law. 

Why would a pharmaceutical company file so many patents after a drug is already on the market? Quite simply to preserve and extend its ability to keep competition at bay while hiking prices. 

The company â which along with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk control nearly the entire U.S. insulin market â has further prevented insulin competition in America by pursuing litigation against two companies that want to offer cheaper biosimilars. (Biosimilars are the generic-like equivalents for complex molecules such as insulin and other biologic drugs.) Like overpatenting, this tactic works against the millions of Americans who must take insulin. 

Putting two or more generics on the market has been shown to drastically reduce drug prices. In Europe and Japan, fewer patent applications and more friendly biosimilar regulatory requirements have led to multiple biosimilar competitors of Lantus, helping drive down prices and improve access to treatment. 

Gestures like Sanofiâs recently expanded patient assistance programs offer savings to struggling patients. But Americans in need of treatment should not have to jump through hoops for medicine that ought to be affordable in the first place. Put another way, âI shouldnât have to go beg for my insulin. It should be affordable to me,â Myranda Pierce, a graduate student at Boston University School of Medicine who has type 1 diabetes, told STAT . 

Unfortunately, the mix of patent thickets , prolonged exclusivity, delayed competition, and jacked-up prices is typical of Americaâs best-selling medications. Overpatenting is so pervasive that a new report from the bipartisan Congressional Diabetes Caucus calls for outlawing âevergreening,â and also proposes other patent reforms because such practices block competition and prevent affordable generics from reaching Americans. 

To get patent reform right, policymakers should not only stop evergreening and pay-for-delay agreements that keep generic alternatives off the market. They must also remember whatâs at the core of a patent: invention. To deserve the title âpatentâ â and the reward of exclusivity that comes with it â a discovery must be truly inventive, not just an incremental improvement. 

Unfortunately, the current patent system too often forgets the inventive part of patent law and hands out 20-year monopolies for âimprovementsâ based on routinely practiced science â whether thatâs putting three pills into one pill to improve adherence or making a slight adjustment to the dosage formulation, as Sanofi claimed in one of its later patents on Lantus. To provide real incentives to help companies usher in the next medical breakthroughs, we need to raise the bar for what is deemed inventive under patent law. If we donât, we should no longer call it a patent system but a monopoly-handout-in-return-for-an-investment system. 

As cited in the I-MAK report on Lantus, Erin Little, an entrepreneur in Kansas City, Mo., told T1International, âNo one I know can afford this drug without assistance, and patient assistance programs, if you even qualify, eventually run out. I had to pay $1,000 for a monthâs supply of Lantus before I found a way to get the same version in Mexico for just $100. Itâs not right. Drug companies are squeezing us for every possible penny. Itâs forcing people to ration drugs and putting lives at risk.â 

Americans deserve better. Thatâs why Minnesotaâs attorney general recently sued the big three insulin makers for price gouging the U.S., why the American Medical Association has called for federal interventions on insulin pricing, and why thereâs a lot riding on the next Congress to rein in rising drug costs. 

As part of the solution, patent reform can help boost competition and transparency and stop companies from dictating sticker-shock prices. There are too many stories of agonized patients struggling to afford treatment, forced to ration their medicine, and left to absorb the cost of high drug prices with their very own bodies.

    <content type="text">Debates on economic policy are often far removed from reality. Nowhere is this truer than in the case of prescription drug prices. 
In the United States, we pay high drug prices because the government gives pharmaceutical companies patent monopolies, where it threatens to arrest anyone that sells a drug in competition with the patent holder. As a result, drugs often sell for prices that are several thousand percent above their free market price. 

Incredibly, in debates on drug prices, these monopoly prices are routinely described as being the result of the free market, turning reality completely on its head. The people who want to lower drug prices are then said to be trying to interfere with the free market, which we are all supposed to think is a bad thing to do. 

This is one of the reasons why a new bill to lower drug prices by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna is so brilliant. The bill is actually lowering drug prices by using the power of the market, making it clear that the proponents of high drug prices are the ones who want the government to interfere with the market to keep drug company profits high. 

The bill would effectively end the patent monopoly for any drug where the price in the United States is above the median of the prices charged in the next seven largest wealthy countries. This is likely to mean a reduction in the price of most brand drugs by around 50 percent. 

The reason is that, while other countries also grant patent monopolies and related protections to drugs, they donât allow the manufacturers to exploit these monopolies to the same extent as in the United States. They have some sort of price negotiation with drug companies, which is intended to place a limit on the price that can be charged when peopleâs health or life is at stake. 

In effect, the SandersâKhanna bill imports the price negotiation process put in place by these other countries. Drug companies will have a strong incentive to set their price below the median of the seven benchmark countries. If they charge a higher price, they effectively lose their patent monopoly. They could still make some money off of licensing fees charged to generic producers, but this would be a small fraction of what they would make from having a patent monopoly. 

Another nice feature of the SandersâKhanna bill is that it would lower drug prices for everyone, not just Medicare patients. There have been a number of bills introduced in recent years that have been designed to reduce the cost of drugs for people in Medicare. While lower drug prices for people enrolled in Medicare would be good, we should be looking to reduce our drug prices across the board. There is no reason people in the United States should be paying so much more than everyone else. 

The industryâs response will be to whine that if they charged lower drug prices they wonât be able to finance the development of new drugs. There is a grain of truth to this, but only a grain. The industry will collect roughly $440 billion (2.2 percent of GDP) in revenue this year from sales in the United States alone. It spends around $70 billion on research. This is less than one-sixth of the money it pulls in. 

Certainly, if we did bring spending down to the levels in other wealthy counties it would lead to somewhat less research, but the question is the size of the falloff in research. After all, by giving another $1.5 trillion to corporations over the next decade, the Trump tax cut will almost certainly lead to some additional investment, but the question is how much. The evidence to date with the tax cut is that we are seeing very little payoff in the form of higher investment. Similarly, the additional revenue from unchecked patent monopolies is likely to translate into little by way of additional research into developing new drugs. 

Ultimately we should be looking to more modern and efficient mechanisms than patent monopolies for financing drug research. The government already spends almost $40 billion a year on biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health. If we paid for the research up front, then all new drugs could be sold at their free market price from day one, saving us close to $400 billion a year. In that world, prescriptions would be $20 or $30 a piece, not hundreds or thousands of dollars. 

But for now, the SandersâKhanna bill is a huge step forward in making drugs affordable. And, it does it by using the market forces, a prospect that is very scary to the pharmaceutical industry.

    <content type="text">The City Council seems likely to pass a resolution endorsing a state single-payer health care bill after a hearing Thursday in which health committee chair Mark Levine fervently supported such a system and criticized its detractors. 
 
Levine derided the status quo in health care, which costs more per capita in the U.S. than in other developed countries without better outcomes. He said that while he supports a national approach, it is unlikely to be taken up by the Trump administration. 
 
"New York need not and must not stand still in the face of inaction at the federal level," he said. 
 
The bill would create a statewide public fund to cover all New Yorkers with no out-of-pocket costs. It received broad support at the hearing from nurses, physicians, social workers, immigrant advocates, disability rights activists and community groups. 
 
The New York Health Act has passed the Assembly four consecutive years, and with the Democrats taking control of the Senate in January, there is an increased chance of the bill's passage next year. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said he believes the federal government is best positioned to take up the issue. 
 
Assemblyman Richard Gottfried and state Sen. Gustavo Rivera plan to reintroduce the bill in January to address fiscal concerns. One new wrinkle, which Gottfried previewed Thursday, is that it will incorporate long-term care, such as nursing home and home care. 
 
"No New York family will have to wipe out their savings, and no family member will have to give up a careerÂ to provide long-term care for a loved one," he said at the hearing. 
 
A coalition called Realities of Single Payer, which includes the state Health Plan Association, state Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, and the Business Council, said in a statement that the hearing was "nothing more than political theater" and a single-payer system would result in higher taxes and decreased access to care. 
 
An analysis in August by Rand Corp. estimated that the state would need to raise $139 billion more in taxes by 2022 to fund the program, an 156% increase above expected levels. The research organization proposed one possible tax structure, as the current bill lacks one. Under its proposal, households earning up to $290,000 would pay a smaller percentage of their income toward health payments, including the new taxes. 
 
The analysis assumed the state would receive a waiver from the federal government to deliver Medicare and Medicaid benefits through its own program while still receiving federal funds. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma has said she wouldn't approve such a waiver. 
 
David Rich, executive vice president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, spoke in opposition to the bill at the hearing. He noted the coverage gains New York has made to lower its uninsured rate to 5% from 10% in 2013 and said there were other ways to insure the remaining 5%. He said he worried a single-payer system would provide lower reimbursement to hospitals than the current system. 
 
"Yes, we must cover the remaining 5% of New Yorkers who are uninsured. Yes, we should make health care affordable," he said. "We can do this without the disruption we think would be caused by a single-payer system." âJonathan LaMantia 
 Â   CareDox expands school wellness services  
Manhattan-based CareDox added 59 contracts with K-12 school districts in the 2018-19 school year, the company said Thursday. 
 
CareDox, founded in 2014, provides health records management technology to schools as well as wellness services, such as flu vaccinations. The new contracts expanded its reach to 7,100 schools and more than 4.9 million student health records. 
 
"We're not growing like a health care companyâmore like a technology company," CEO Hesky Kutscher said. 
 
Before this year CareDox offered wellness services in Texas and Florida. It now also offers services in Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia and Washington, and provides its technology platform in 38 states. The company employs about 90 people. 
 
The continued shift to value-based care and the need to be more proactive in addressing health care has been a benefit to CareDox, Kutscher said, adding that he would like to expand wellness services to New York in the next 12 to 18 months. 
 
The company's business plan involves billing insurance companies directly for students who receive services. 
 
Kutscher decline to provide the financial terms of the company's latest contracts. - Jennifer Henderson 
 Employer-sponsored insurance costs soar in NY, report says  
Employer-sponsored insurance-premium costs for single and family coverage saw double-digit increases in New York last year, according to a new study from Manhattan-based nonprofit The Commonwealth Fund. 
 
From 2016 to 2017, average annual premium costs increased 10.5%, to $7,309, for single coverage and 10%, to $21,317, for family coverage. That compared with increases of 4.4%, to $6,368, for single coverage and 5.5%, to $18,687, for family coverage nationwide during the same period. 
 
"The cost of employer health insurance premiums and deductibles continues to outpace growth in workers' wages," said Sara Collins, lead author of the study and Commonwealth Fund vice president for health care coverage and access, in a statement. "Policies that would reduce health care burdens on employees include fixing the Affordable Care Act's family-coverage glitch, requiring employers to exclude some services from the deductible and increasing the required minimum value of employer plans." 
 
In the state, the total potential annual out-of-pocket costs for employees grew 14.7%, to $7,393, last year, or 12% of median income. This was up from $6,445, or 11% of median income, in 2016. 
 
"The higher the out-of-pocket costs, the less likely you are to access care when you need it," Collins said. That includes filling prescription drugs, she said. âJ.H. 
 Community Trust grants $375K to fight opioid addiction  
The New York Community Trust plans to spend $375,000 to help agencies addressing opioid addiction in its latest round of grant-making, the organization will announce today. 
 
Three organizations each will receive $125,000 for an 18-month period: Community Health Action of Staten Island, Services for the Underserved and VIP Community Services. 
 
Community Health Action will relocate Staten Island's only 24-hour, drop-in drug-treatment recovery center to a larger space. Services for the Underserved will train peer workers, who have experienced addiction, to help connect others, particularly the homeless, to services. VIP Community Services in the Bronx will add weekend services at its addiction-treatment program. 
 
"Paying for treatment can be really expensive, and our dollars wouldn't go very far," said Irfan Hasan, program director of health and behavioral health at NYCT. "It's the right mix of groups where modest amounts of money could improve access and get to people particularly in need." 
 
Hasan said the trust, which gets much of its charity dollars through bequests, has not yet received a donation designated for substance-use treatment, so it uses flexible funding to support such programs. 
 
The investment follows several government funding commitments. Gov. Andrew Cuomo awarded $9 million in federal funds for that purpose earlier this week, and Mayor Bill de Blasio committed $8 million to combat addiction in the Bronx. âJ.L.

We committed to the housing before we knew what the needs were,â James Introne, the New York deputy secretary of health from 2011 to 2013, told the reporters.Â

    <content type="text">Leaders of healthcare payer organizations anticipate revenues to rise next year, but many are not prepared for the change. 
A majority of healthcare payer leaders expect substantial revenue growth next year, though some remain unprepared for change, according to a new industry survey. 
 
More than 80% of payer organization executives anticipate revenue growth in 2019, according to the annual North Highland Beacon report released Thursday . Sixteen percent of executives expect more than 10% growth while 38% expect between 5 to 9% growth. 
 
Meanwhile, 19% of respondents anticipate flat or declining revenues next year, and when asked about their sentiments heading into 2019, the largest shift was an increase in feeling time-strapped and disorganized.Â  
 
Roman Fry, healthcare payor principal at North Highland, a consulting firm, told HealthLeadersÂ  that the reason most executives are responding this way is due to widespreadÂ M&amp;A activity andÂ joint ventures across healthcare in a "race to the top." 
 
"If you're constantly integrating and bringing in new companies, business units, and growing, it's really hard to streamline your operations," Fry said. "I think it points back to point everybody trying to jump into 'how do we become a leader in value-based care?' as we're somewhere in between the move from fee-for-service to value-based care."Â  
 Top priorities to fuel growth next year: Â   Customer experience  Data and analytics  Organic growth  Operational efficiency, including new market penetration and product innovation  
Fry advised payer leaders to focus on one to three areas for improvement in order to institute organizational change that will create value for members and physicians. He said that leaders who try to address multiple areas often confuse and frustrate employees.Â  
 
Related: 3 Thoughts on Proactive Leadership inÂ Healthcare 
 Obstacles to attaining 2019 goals:  Insufficient human bandwidth and resources  Solid business strategy  Adequate knowledge/skills  
Fry said that similar to the way executives target what drives value for consumers, they should use the same approach for their employees.Â  
 
"What's interesting in healthcare is that these employees are on your insurance, they're actually a member as well,"Â Â Fry said. "Take care of employees first, if not, someone else will. Pay as close attention to employee experience as you do customer experience, and you'll do well." 
 Additional observations about payer organizations in 2019:  Fry said payer executives maintain high confidence in AI usage but place it as a low priority and haven'tÂ fully recognized its value yet.  He added that creating a seamless online and offline user experience is vital for future success.  Just as insurers have encountered outside corporate disruptions this year, the "wait-and-see" approach fromÂ health systems could also invite disruptors in 2019.  Fry did say that providers should consider pursuing joint ventures with payers in order to succeed in the rapidly consolidating market.  "To make profit and keep operating well, you have to have a partnership strategy in place, be working towards it, or have some way to respond to value-based care," Fry said.</content>

    <content type="text">John O'Brien, a pharmacist with experience in the private sector and government, will serve as HHS' point man on drug pricing policy. He replaces Dan Best, who died unexpectedly last month.  
Pharmacist and veteran drug policy expert John O'Brien has been named Senior Advisor to the Secretary for Drug Pricing Reform, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced Thursday. 
 
O'Brien replaces Dan Best, who died unexpectedly last month. 
 
Previously, O'Brien was Azar's advisor for health reform and drug pricing, and deputy assistant secretary for health policy in HHS's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. 
 
"John O'Brien has already been an integral leader in HHS's efforts to bring down the high price of prescription drugs," Azar said in a media release . 
 
"As a senior advisor, he will carry forward the legacy of our departed colleague Dan Best and build on the substantial progress that has already been made. John will continue to play an important role in our overall efforts to deliver Americans better, more affordable healthcare," Azar said. 
 
Before joining HHS, O'Brien, was vice president of public policy for CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. He has also worked at the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the Notre Dame of Maryland University College of Pharmacy, and other pharmaceutical organizations. 
 
O'Brien has a master's degree in public health from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, a doctor of pharmacy degree from Nova Southeastern University, and studied pharmacy and public policy at the University of Florida. 
 
Addressing rising drug prices has been a key issue for the Trump Administration, and Congress, and it is expected to gain even more attention over the next two years in the run-up to the 2020 election. 
 
In the past few months, Azar has promised "disruptive change." 
 
The former president of Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Azar has floated a number of proposals, including: allowing Medicare Part D plans greater leeway to decline to cover certain protected-class drugs beginning in 2020;  eliminating drug rebates ; mandatoryÂ  transparency in drug pricing; and linking Medicare Part B drug prices to an international index . 
 
Although Azar has touting an aggressive agenda on drug pricing, he hasn't acted on it, and observers note he is careful not to get too far in front of President Donald Trump. 
 
At this point, it's not clear if HHS will act on these initiatives or if they're merely well-vetted window dressing.

    <content type="text">As the Trump administration continues to pump out new proposals to guard the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services against high drug prices, its law enforcement arm has also been busy rounding up biopharma companies that it says have essentially bought their ways into reimbursement for their ever-more-expensive therapies. 
 
Actelion has been made the latest example, having agreed to pay $360 million to resolve kickback allegations. 
 
Jean-Paul Clozel 
 
The scheme â which violated the False Claims Act, according to the US Attorneyâs Office â allegedly took place between 2014 and 2015, when Jean-Paul Clozel was still in charge and before J&amp;J began engaging in a bid that culminated in a $30 billion buyout in 2017 . 
 
Per the allegations, Actelion used an assistance foundation to cover co-pays for thousands of Medicare patients taking its drugs for pulmonary arterial hypertension, including Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri and Opsumit. By footing these required payments, the government says, the company was inducing patients to purchases drugs with otherwise prohibitive high prices â and piling up bills for Medicare. 
 
Actelion also allegedly directed Medicare patients who qualified for its own free drug program to the foundation instead, further milking government reimbursement. 
 
Importantly, the government added, Actelion budgeted its donations to the foundation carefully to make sure that its contribution would not cover patients taking rival PAH drugs. It did so by keeping close track of the number of patients the foundation helped and the amount spent on them. 
 
Joseph Hunt 
 
âPharmaceutical companies cannot have it both ways â they cannot continue to increase drug prices while engaging in conduct designed to defeat the mechanisms that Congress designed to check such prices and then expect Medicare to pay for the ballooning costs,â said Assistant Attorney General Joseph Hunt of the Department Justiceâs Civil Division in a statement. 
 
During the period covered in the settlement, US Attorney Andrew Lelling noted, âActelion raised the price of its main PAH drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of overall inflation in the United States.â 
 
Caring Voice Coalition, the medical charity involved in the scheme, got into troubles of its own late last year when the government revoked its rights to provide such co-pay assistance to patients, due to concerns about improper influence from drugmakers. 
 
United Therapeutics, another PAH drugmaker, settled a similar probe a month later for $210 million, one of the first to emerge from an industry-wide investigation.

Welcome to Capsuleâyour weekly dose of health-care news, where we give you a recap of this weekâs highs and lows for key players in the health-care industry. You can expect us every Friday morning as a bookend for your week. 
 
Even Iâll admit Capsule isnât as fun to read as news coverage of Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopraâs wedding . Lucky for you, we keep Capsule shorter than Chopraâs wedding veil (which was 75 feet long ). On that note, letâs take a look at this weekâs health policy news. 

  
Hereâs who ended the week on a high note: 

 Consolidation Crusaders   When drug companies, insurers, or drug middlemen team up, the move is typically criticized for creating monopoly-like companies that will take away patientsâ choice and purchasing power. But a major health insurer says itâs cutting costs through teaming up with health-care providers, potentially a good sign for those who support consolidation within the health-care industry.  Highmark Inc. cut the cost of care for 2,000 of its sickest members through a new program that includes a team of Allegheny Health Network health-care providers, Sara Hansard reports. Within a year, the costs to treat the patients, who have at least six chronic conditions, were reduced by about 20 percent, and emergency room visits were reduced by 13 percent.  The Highmark CEO didnât provide any data to support his claims, so take the cost cutting with a grain of salt. But if itâs true, it could appease those who say consolidation always eventually leads to higher prices.   Health-Care Accounts  John OâBrien   HHS Secretary Alex Azar tapped John OâBrien to become the departmentâs new âdrug czarâ Dec. 6, a sign Azar is looking for consistency within the agency after a former drug adviserâs death. OâBrien has held multiple positions within the Health and Human Services Department, including adviser to the secretary for health reform and drug pricing and deputy assistant secretary for heath policy.  Now OâBrien will head up the agencyâs efforts to lower drug prices, a high profile position given the Trump administrationâs efforts to lower health-care costs. He replaces Daniel Best, the former secretary for drug pricing reform.  Like his predecessor, OâBrien has experience working for industry stakeholders, including BlueCross BlueShield. Heâs also worked for the federal Medicare agency though. That experience will likely come in handy because many of the Trump administrationâs drug policy changes have revolved around Medicare drug plans.    
It was a bleak week for others. Hereâs whose Thursday closed on a downswing: 

 Drug Policies Overseas   If you think drug policies in the U.S. are riddled with problems, you should take a look across the pond. Drugmakers like GlaxosmithKline and Pfizer with plants in the U.K. arenât entirely sure how their U.S.-bound drugs are going to be inspected after Brexit, Jeannie Baumann reports.  The European Medicines Agency stopped assigning work to the U.K.âs pharmaceutical regulator earlier this year, unsure whether the two organizations will need to stop collaborating after Britain leaves the European Union in March, according to Bloomberg News.  Meanwhile in Russia , drugmakers and distributors will begin to see extra costs and regulatory hurdles late next year under a new Russian law that expands drug quality certification requirements, Sergei Blagov writes.  As for Trumpâs latest Chinese fentanyl agreement, thereâs a good chance itâll fall through , Bloomberg News reports. This week China promised to tighten supervision and revise rules around the production of the highly addictive opioid painkiller thatâs often shipped to the U.S.. But that will be a hard promise to keep, in part because the ingredients are commonly used in legitimate products and arenât widely regulated.   Medicare Expansion   Democrats are pushing for policies that would allow some to buy into the public health insurance for seniors, Alex Ruoff reports. Supporters are selling the idea as a commonsense, low-cost step toward bolder proposals like Medicare for All in hopes of gaining the support of those who want to give free health insurance to all Americans.  However, expanding Medicare to more patients isnât popular among Republicans and was pummeled this week by a top Trump administration health-care official, Shira Stein writes.  The administrationâs health-care officials have previously argued against Medicare for All, but this is the first time any of them have argued against allowing people currently ineligible for Medicare to buy into the program, Stein notes.   Patenting Treatments   Drugmakers are eagerly awaiting the outcome of a court battle between branded drugmaker Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. and generic maker Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., Dana Elfin reports. The oral arguments were yesterday, and the dispute is over whether a treatment method for an existing opioid drug is able to be patented.  The question of what ideas can or canât be patented is a major topic in life sciences and the invalidation of a patent has huge financial consequences for parties in the lawsuit. This court case could also set a dangerous precedent for certain drug companies.  If Endo loses, it could push drug companies to shift their research and development efforts away from exploring new uses for existing drugs.

    <content type="text">Dublin, Dec. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients Market - Segmented by Business mode, Synthesis Type, Customer Base, Therapeutic Area, And Geography - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2018 - 2023)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. 

The active pharmaceutical ingredients market was valued at USD 160.3 million in 2017, is expected to register a CAGR of about 6.1% during the forecast period, 2018-2023. 

A huge impact from pharmaceutical industry, increasing adoption of biological and biosimilars, and rising prevalence of cancer are the major factors fueling the growth of the active pharmaceutical ingredients market. 

Increasing Adoption of Biologicals and Biosimilars Propels the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Market 

Biosimilars, sometimes referred to as biogenerics, are highly similar versions of biologics - medicines that are made from living microorganisms found in plant or animal cells. Most biologics are very large and complex molecules, or mixtures of molecules, used to treat cancer, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, and other serious diseases. 

Biosimilars may serve as lower-cost options, and may hold the potential to create a more sustainable healthcare system by making room for innovation, so that more patients continue to receive the best possible care. As per a report by Amgen on biosimilars, in 2015, the first biosimilar approved by the US FDA was Zarxio. Since then, there has been a dramatic increase in applications submitted to the FDA for review, and many more are expected in the near future. 

The US healthcare community has firmly taken the first step into a new reality, which includes assessing the addition of biosimilars to the specialty drug portfolio.Other factors driving this market are huge impact from pharmaceutical industry, increasing adoption of biological and biosimilars, and rising prevalence of cancer. 

Stringent Regulations Acts as a Major Barrier for the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Market 

One of the major factors acting as an obstacle is the stringent regulatory framework across several regions. The quality of APIs has a significant effect on the efficacy and safety of medications. Poorly manufactured or compromised APIs have been connected to serious issues, such as illnesses and even death. Even in the case of outsourcing, APIs are subject to stringent regulations and oversight from the country they are shipped to. 

For example, API manufacturing plants overseas still go through an inspection by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration. Moreover, the differences in the regulatory requirements in each country have made this an extremely complex market in the recent times. With European Union, several other countries are adopting fierce regulatory requirements and enforcing API inspection system similar to the level of FDA. This is a step towards standardized regulatory framework globally. 

These factors restrict the growth of companies in many regions and hinder the growth of this market.Other factors affecting this market are the drug price control policies across various countries, large capital investment, production cost, and the fierce competition between the API manufacturers. 

Market Segmentation Insights 

The global API market is segmented by the business mode, type of synthesis, by customer base, and by geography. 

By business mode, it is further segmented into captive API and merchant API. The captive API segment of the market studied is defined as APIs used by pharmaceutical companies for in-house production of finished dosage forms. In 2017, this segment held 60% revenue share in the market. 

By type of synthesis, it is further segmented into synthetic and biotech. Active pharmaceutical ingredients based on their sources can be divided into two major categories, including chemical synthetic drugs and natural chemical drugs. 

By customer base, the market is further segmented into generic and branded. The generic API segment of the market studied holds the largest share and is expected to outpace the growth rates of branded APIs. 

By application, it is further segmented into cardiology, pulmonology, oncology, ophthalmology, neurology, and orthopedics. The incidence and prevalence of cancer is increasing year on year, which implies the requirement for the research and development of new APIs in the oncology segment to meet the demands of growing incidence which drives the market in the forecast period. 

Asia-Pacific is expected to have High Growth Opportunities in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Market 

The Asia-Pacific is expected to register a high growth rate compared to other regions during the forecast period, owing to the factors such as increasing healthcare expenditures, growing aging population creating a huge patient pool, and rising economies in this region. 

For example, China is considered as the leader in API manufacturing in the APAC region. There are many domestic companies involved in the manufacturing and supplying of API all over the world. Not just in the Asia-Pacific region, China exports the major share of its domestically produced API around the world. 

The low price of the API has boosted the China API export market. Moreover, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) have taken measure to reduce the healthcare expenditure and decided to promote the use of generic drugs. 

Market Developments 

ACETO Corporation with Rising Pharmaceuticals launched Atenolol tablets, 25mg, 50mg, and 100mg for hypertension. 

Novo Nordisk invested an additional USD 65 million into the plant established in Clayton, North Carolina for building a USD 2 billion API facility there. 

Sterling Pharma Solutions expanded its presence in the Asia region with growth experienced in the Japanese API market.

    <content type="text">Arcadia.io reported that independent research firm Forrester ranked its population health management platform Arcadia Analytics as the top in the current offering category in their Healthcare Analytics evaluation.

According to a media release, Arcadia was among the select companies that Forrester invited to participate in its evaluation, "The Forrester Wave: Healthcare Analytics, Q4 2018: The 11 Providers That Matter Most and How They Stack Up". In this evaluation, Arcadia was cited as a Strong Performer and was given the highest scores in the solution architecture and user experience criteria across all evaluated vendors. The report evaluated 11 of the most significant healthcare analytics providers. "Arcadia.io is the best fit for mid- to large-size providers and health plans entering or taking on risk in value-based care payment models," wrote Arielle Trzcinski, senior analyst at Forrester in the report. "These organizations will benefit from its analytics capabilities and broad solution portfolio."

"We are gratified by Forrester's recognition of our product strength," said Sean Carroll, chief executive officer at Arcadia. "We have invested heavily in cutting-edge technologies that help drive real outcomes for our customers. Our cloud-based distributed computing platform derives insights from healthcare Big Data and delivers actionable information to different users where and when they need it. We have been laser-focused on building the capabilities that large healthcare enterprises need to achieve financial success in value based care."

"Arcadia.io provides features that support multiple roles in an organization, spanning data gurus to executives," wrote Trzcinski. "Strengths include data acquisition and data exchange along with the ability to connect directly to EHR data stores and to push insights to the provider through a contextual application that automatically opens the same patient record across Arcadia.io and an EHR."

"Real improvement in care quality, utilization, and risk documentation comes from individual providers making informed decisions with individual patients in the exam room," explains Rich Parker, MD, the chief medical officer at Arcadia.io. "But those physicians want to spend the visit focused on the patient in front of them rather than switching back and forth between the EHR and an analytics platform. Our desktop app and APIs provide rich patient context within the provider's preferred workspace."

"By investing in our technology and aligning analytics with existing workflows for clinicians and administrators alike, health systems can finally see success with population health," continued Parker. "We believe this was key to the industry leading outcomes our customers have achieved, be it the $90M in savings our customers generated in the MSSP program, or the 81 percent improvement in in-visit diagnosis capture customers have achieved when focusing on more accurately documenting HCC and commercial risk."

    <content type="text">Decision Resources Group (DRG) reported new findings from the DRG National Managed Care Organization Commercial Analyzer.

According to a media release, as the managed care market pursues vertical integration and diversification, DRG sees disruptive change ahead for the U.S. healthcare system. DRG said that its latest MCO Analyzer Commercial Landscape report finds that a key aspect of the current healthcare evolution is the development of regional integrated delivery networks, where co-owned and partnered hospitals are banding together as a regional system near urban centers. Such structures can frustrate carriers' attempts to gain competitive hospital contracts but have the advantage of providing greater support for IDN-affiliated hospitals in exurbs and small towns.

Even the largest hospital chains are organizing their holdings into regional networks to consolidate their oversight and maximize the potential for collaboration. The systems can include affiliated home health, hospice, rehabilitation and nursing facilities. As more insurers seek value-based contracts with high-performing hospitals, these regional systems will be able to support shared electronic health records and technology assets to make these arrangements work well.

Additional key commercial market developments in 2018 according to the DRG National Managed Care Organization Commercial Analyzer include:

-Employer frustration over drug prices: Employers are reaching for some new tools in their efforts to contain medical costs, including drug benefit changes, direct contracts with providers, greater use of employer-based clinics, hired health coordinators and coaches, and more.

-Carriers push providers toward downside risk: Carriers are taking different approaches to getting value-based providers to assume downside risk.

-Insurer-PBM mergers: Mergers won't resolve the push for transparent pricing but may better position health plans to deliver better clinical support to physicians and prescribers.

-Largest employers explore new healthcare options: From Amazon to Walmart, more top employers are trying out new ways to deliver lower-cost healthcare to their employees.

Comments from DRG Principal Analyst Paula Wade: "Every segment of the healthcare system from physician practices to the largest insurers are merging, diversifying or aligning themselves with larger players to prepare for whatever policy changes or competitive game-changers are ahead whether it's the end of the ACA, a move toward Medicare-for-all, or a transformative development from Google."

    <content type="text">Users of Bernoulli One, the flagship platform of Bernoulli Health, are the most likely of any customer base to report high trust in their alerts, according to a limited number of clients interviewed for a new KLAS report that assessed the impact of clinical surveillance solutions on patient safety, care and outcomes.

According to a media release, all customers surveyed in Clinical Surveillance 2018 trusted Bernoulli One's ability to identify physiological trends that point to a potential adverse patient event and communicate an actionable alert to the appropriate clinician for rapid intervention. "Bernoulli One is awesome at driving patient interventions. We have some floors that are so spread out that we can't monitor them ourselves," said one hospital leader. "If a patient's stats drop, the system sets off an alarm at the nurse station and a nurse can go check on the patient."

KLAS provided the following report highlights:

Patient Safety, Transformed

The KLAS report indicated that "clinical surveillance tools hold the promise of giving caregivers clinically actionable insights that decrease mortality, reduce readmissions, and improve overall patient outcomes, and clinicians expect these alerts to be embedded directly within their workflow."

As the market's only real-time, end-to-end, connected healthcare platform, Bernoulli One combines vendor-agnostic medical device integration with powerful data aggregation, clinical surveillance, telemedicine/virtual ICU, advanced alarm management, advanced analytics and robust distribution capabilities.

Bernoulli One aggregates and filters continuous, real-time data from patient monitoring devices with retrospective data from the EHR to provide a holistic and complete source of objective information on any patient.

Additionally, Bernoulli One's 'smart alarm' capabilities identifies clinically relevant trends, sustained conditions, reoccurrences and combinatorial indications, while filtering out the non-actionable alerts that often lead to clinical fatigue.

With an FDA Class II clearance for use in both patient monitoring and secondary alarm management, Bernoulli One's smart alarms allow for the analysis of alarm signals, as well as the high-fidelity physiological data associated with thema critical pillar of clinical surveillance.

A director of cardiology noted, "Clinicians trust the accuracy of the alerts produced by Bernoulli One. We have done some studies in terms of alarms and alarm response. We have noticed that the response to Bernoulli-prompted alarms is much better. In the past, the nurses knew why the ventilators' alarms were going off, but they thought they could get to them in a moment. Now with Bernoulli One, the nurses know that when they hear the alarm, they need to respond right away."

EHR Optimization

While the real-time surveillance market continues to evolve, the potential to make significant, positive impacts on resource utilization, workflow efficiencies, length of stay readmissions and other value-based care metrics is immense, said Janet Dillione, CEO of Bernoulli Health.

"Bernoulli One's clinical surveillance capabilities can decisively close significant gaps in patient safety that current monitoring practices can't match," said Dillione. "Our platform's integration capabilities means that real-time patient safety initiatives can be centered around the EHR without adding unnecessary inefficiencies and burdens to clinical workflow."

The central role the EHR plays in day-to-day clinical operations requires that peripheral technologies integrate with the system. Bernoulli One's seamless integration into any EHR measurably improves automation of patient documentation and simplified clinical workflow, providing a positive impact on provider satisfaction and patient outcomes.

Experience Matters

Bernoulli Health has extensive experience providing medical device integration into the EHR for hospitals and health systems. Bernoulli One connects virtually any clinical system including patient monitors, ventilators, specialty monitors and devices, EHR system and third-party care team communication solutions.

"Bernoulli One has provided a safety net for our nurses, who have felt more comfortable since we started using the system," said one customer interviewed by KLAS. "We use it mainly for our postop patients. We have alerts at the nurse station, and alarm limits are on the pulse oximeter that the system is connected to."

Bernoulli Thought Leadership

Bernoulli has a robust online Knowledge Center of white papers, case studies, blog posts and an eBook detailing emerging trends in alarm management and medical device integration, as well as real-world customer success stories using the Bernoulli One platform.

HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF. - NEWS CONFERENCE

DECEMBER 6, 2018

SPEAKERS:      HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.

[*]      PELOSI:  Good morning.

QUESTION:  Good morning.

PELOSI:  As you know, yesterday, the nation observed a day of mourning as we said goodbye to President George Herbert Walker Bush. We grieve the loss of a great stateman -- statesman and leader. President Bush preached the values of duty, sacrifice, commitment and patriotism; he said that in his speeches.

We took great pride in President George Herbert Walker Bush, served as a member of the House. That was before I was here, but some of our colleagues that I served with served with him and always shared positive views of how he worked with them on Ways and Means Committee, et cetera.

I had the privilege of working with him as a new member of Congress in the time of the Loma Prieta earthquake. He came to San Francisco with, again, all of the compassion and openness to how we could go forward under -- at a very, very sad time. So the -- it's again a privilege to work with him. He was a blessing to our country. It's very sad -- this -- right before we assumed the majority in January of 2007, in that December proceeding we lost President Gerald Ford.

They -- they were two great presidents of the United States. They shared one thing in common -- many things, being president of the United States, but also, as I acknowledged in my remarks in that January '07, President Gerald Ford received the Profile in Courage Award from the Kennedy Library and so did President George Herbert Walker Bush; a reflection of the -- the impact that they had on our country, to act in a way that went beyond politics and was about our -- our values.

It's quite a week. It's a sad week. We also observed the passing of our colleague in Arizona -- we'll have the service tomorrow; he died in the past week -- of Ed Pastor.

He was the first Latino congressman elected from Arizona. A trailblazing leader on -- members looked to him from all over the caucus, across the aisle and across the spectrum of diversity in our caucus. And he was always there, advocating for people of color, communities of color and the immigrant community, as well as a cardinal on the Appropriations Committee, helping to promote our values in that way.

PELOSI:  Again, yesterday I had the great -- yesterday we had an observance of the six-year anniversary of Newtown -- that is this month, that wasn't last night, but they observed -- observance here in D.C. was last night. So sad. So many people came who've had their own personal grief from individual losses in their family. One family there, just in a matter of weeks lost a family member.

And also some representatives of the -- the tragedy in Florida -- Patricia and Manny spoke, the father of Joaquin -- is very, very moving. Actually, I've met them -- met Manny -- Manuel in Florida recently and when I went in to -- through the press event, it was a roundtable discussion but the press was present -- he had orange hair.

And so when I went in, after we went around and people spoke, he said, "I want to explain to you why I have orange hair, because I thought when I walked in, you thought that that was strange." I said, "Me? I'm from San Francisco. I don't think orange hair is strange."

(LAUGHTER)

But it was orange for the color of gun violence prevention. Green is also one -- one of the colors.

But he was there last night with his hair dyed back again and I made a commitment that we will pass common-sense gun violence prevention legislation soon. And that will be bipartisan. We're very proud of that.

Again, as we lay President George Herbert Walker Bush to -- to rest, my -- my -- one of my daughters lives in Houston. Her family there, they went to -- she went -- her and her friends went to see him at -- late last night. And she reported back to me this morning that even at 1:30 in the morning, when they were leaving, there were still thousands of people in line to see him.

This -- I -- I used to say to him -- to -- he was really a sweetheart, a really lovely man.

And one point that I want to make that I think wasn't emphasized enough was his leadership on the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act.

It transformed our nation. It was an example to the world in making our workplaces, our transportation systems and our voting booths and other buildings accessible, while reducing discrimination against people with disabilities.

That reaffirmed our fundamental truth, that we respect people for what they can do, not judge them for what they cannot. That applies across the board.

And again, at the National Cathedral, it was beautiful, it was -- it was lovely and bipartisan and unifying for our country.

So as we are inspired once again by that, as we was -- we were by the passing of Senator McCain, we have someone who has been in this -- this group (ph) that you may have some questions about.

The farm bill, that looks good. The -- as we were leaving the service yesterday, I was pleased to hear what Senator Roberts and Senator Stabenow have to say about that, so we're hoping that that can be passed maybe next week, we'll see.

The MeToo legislation -- back in February, the House unanimously passed the MeToo Congress bill. Discussions continue. I think we're finding some common ground, and we would hope that this overdue legislation will be passed before the end of the Congress. We're making some progress there.

VAWA -- we're in the middle of another short-term Violence Against Women Act and we should be passing a strong long-term bill. We'd like to do it this Congress. It's -- been in this -- but if not, we'll have to take it up at the beginning of next year, but we'd rather do it in the Congress in which it was debated and rest in (ph) -- in the committee.

As you know, the appropriations bill is the door-opener or door-closer or whatever -- however you -- it's dispositive of when we all go home. And that gives it not only a policy urgency but a scheduling question.

PELOSI:  We are -- you know, we're supposed to meet with the president this week, but with the death of our president, we now -- President Bush, we're -- that meeting, we'll meet with the president next week as we go forward to negotiate that.

And then just one last thing:  As you've seen in the press, the Senate was briefed on the Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Khashoggi matters. We will have that briefing next week:  Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the full Congress; Khashoggi for a limited, more classified briefing, as -- same as was done in the Senate.

So here we are. I'm -- get ready, but it's pretty exciting to have won a minimum of 40 seats; more to come, maybe. One more to come, maybe. And it is wonderful that we had the biggest midterm vote in the history of our country, and Democrats (inaudible) by more than 10 million votes. Quite remarkable.

Our message was for the people, lower health care cost by reducing the cost of prescription drugs. And as you know, pre-existing conditions were -- that benefit was an important part of that debate. Lower health care cost, increased paychecks by building infrastructure of America, and -- in a green way, and third, to restore integrity in government, starting with the important H.R. 1. Some of you were here when -- last week, when John Sarbanes, with a number of the freshmen, presented that legislation.

Just to update you on that, there -- we may be moving -- separating Voting Rights Act out of that so that we can move more quickly with H.R. 1, and the Voting Rights Act, we want to establish an ironclad constitutional record when we pass it -- which will be soon, but not as soon as moving the voting rights -- the H.R. 1 with the other ways to reduce the role of money in government and increase the voices of the American -- of the American people.

Any questions? (inaudible) have less to -- go ahead.

QUESTION:  Two questions.

There's a -- there's a report out there that you're considering limiting the terms of committee chairmen. Is that something that's actively being discussed?

PELOSI:  Well, I'm not. That has to -- that's a matter before the caucus.

I've always been sympathetic to the concerns that have been expressed by our members on that subject. I've -- actually, I tried to do that when I became speaker in '07, but the caucus did not support that.

But -- but that -- again, our chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, whom you've heard from here, has received many -- much interest in that. And what I've told some of the freshman class, other members have -- have asked for that to be considered, and I say that's -- that's a debate for the -- for the caucus to have, and we will have that.

Whether that happens this year, you know, in the next couple weeks -- because the freshmen aren't here, and we have to have that discussion with them here. So how do we do that? Teleconference or what? Or is that just something we take up next year, but could apply soon? Or they may reject it. (inaudible)

QUESTION:  I also wanted to ask, there's a report that you're going to be meeting Lighthizer about the NAFTA Two. Is that...

PELOSI:  A different (inaudible)

QUESTION:  What's your -- what's your message, going into that?

PELOSI:  Well, I'm -- as I've said before here, Lighthizer has been a very open to discussion on the -- I -- I said the name was (inaudible) but you -- you reported that I said the bill was (inaudible), and that's when I said, you know, NAFTA -- the bill formerly known as Prince. This bill...

(LAUGHTER)

... this bill does not have -- it has good features to it, but they don't matter at all if you don't have enforcement. So enforcement in terms of the labor provisions, enforcement in terms of the environmental provisions. I think he full well understands that. That's our conversation.

PELOSI:  Also central to going forward is that Mexico is supposed to pass a bill that would address the wages and working conditions of Mexican workers. We're not there to exploit workers in Mexico or exploit workers in the United States or in Canada.

So again, that -- that passage of the bill is fundamental to our going forward with that and that hasn't happened yet.

But -- and this is nothing new. I've said this again and again. I've -- I said it was a work in progress. I hope the -- I know it's work, I hope it's progress.

(CROSSTALK)

QUESTION:  Madam Leader, you mentioned meeting with the president again on appropriations and things. There seems to be a push again on -- on the wall. I've heard from a lot of Republicans in the House that they might have trouble moving legislation on the wall. They had two bills that failed this year on the wall.

Would you be willing to support some degree of wall funding if you got a permanent, bona fide solution on DACA?

PELOSI:  No.

QUESTION:  Why not?

PELOSI:  Well, because they're two different subjects.

We're -- we're -- asked what we want in this negotiation, I think I can say, and it wouldn't be a surprise to anybody, is we'd like to just go in and say we're -- we're in -- it's December, the time that we've lost now another week -- I mean, for a legitimate purpose, but nonetheless, we're getting closer to when this C.R. expires. And, of course, we're extending it for two weeks and -- and in that two weeks, we'd have to -- within that two weeks, I wouldn't even say the out -- latest possible day, but within that two weeks we have before us all of the factors, all of the issues that we need to make a decision. I think what we can do that makes sense is to pass the six -- the six bills where the members of the Appropriations Committee have come to terms -- you've heard me say it over and over, left to their own devices the appropriators can come to a -- a -- a good conclusion -- and then -- and then have a C.R. only for homeland security as we go forward. And that's pretty much where our position is now.

Yes?

QUESTION:  Madam Leader, you -- you mentioned Jamal Khashoggi and the -- the Yemen briefing next week. The Senate right now is working in a bipartisan way on a bill that would cut off U.S. assistance to Saudi aid in Yemen, would cut off offensive arms sales to Saudi and would sanction up to MBS.

Is -- the House Republicans aren't going to move on that. Is that a bill you would want to ...

PELOSI:  House Republicans are what?

QUESTION:  Are not going to move on that in the next month.

PELOSI:  No.

QUESTION:  But the (inaudible), it would send a signal. Would you want to take up something similar next year?

PELOSI:  Well, we do have a -- a -- they've had their briefing, we'll have ours, and I'll -- can answer the question better.

But we do have in our own -- right now, in a bipartisan way, support for our bill on Yemen that Ro Khanna and Ranking Member, soon to be chairman, Smith -- Adam Smith are supporting and I support, as well. And also Jim McGovern, who I mentioned earlier, has a bill cutting off arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

So there are pieces of that that exist in different legislation. Let's see after the briefing where we go.

I -- I -- I'm not familiar with the consequence, I thought that they were just condemning -- condemning the fact that Saudi Arabia and the royal family were involved in the -- in the death of Khashoggi.

QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) still trying to figure it out?

PELOSI:  I don't know if that -- if those -- no, I don't think anybody's trying to figure it out; I think we know. I mean, the -- it's a question of whether we accept.

But we'll know more next week.

QUESTION:  And just briefly, who's -- who's briefing next week?

PELOSI:  Excuse me?

QUESTION:  Do you know who from the administration will be conducting the briefing?

PELOSI:  Well, I'm hoping that we would have -- that the director of the CIA, as well as the other leaders in the intelligence community.

QUESTION:  Madam Leader, can I ask one of -- you mentioned the MeToo bills. I'm wondering why has it taken so long, if the House and Senate have passed separate bills, to get to an agreement.

And do you believe that whatever -- of the options that are out there, they go far enough so that you guys are utilizing the moment and the -- you know, the political moment that is happening to get as far as you need to to make sure that Congress is acting appropriately?

PELOSI:  Well, if they do not, you know, if it comes to a place that we've -- we're pretty far down the road but not as far as we want to go, we can -- that will be for the whole Congress, for them to take other action that applies to the House.

QUESTION:  But do you -- are you -- do you know what has taken so long? Why's it been so difficult to reach an agreement (inaudible) the House and Senate can pass?

PELOSI:  Well, the -- the bills were quite different, they were quite different. But now there's -- they're coming closer together. You know what the bills are, they're quite different. Coming closer together.

But the reason we'd be willing to accept something less than we passed is that we then can pass bills ourselves that apply to the House, and I think that would put some pressure on the Senate to do the same.

QUESTION:  Madam Leader, can I ask you about what's going on in North Carolina?

PELOSI:  Yes.

QUESTION:  Are you -- do you believe a new election should be called in the 9th District, given what's come out regarding that election? And if there is not a new election, do you think Mr. Harris should be seated as a House member?

And I also want to ask you about the allegations -- or not allegations, but what Congressman-elect Spano in Florida -- he has said that he has -- he has admitted to taking illegal loans in his campaign. Do you believe that that should cast doubt on whether he should be seated as a -- as a new member?

PELOSI:  Well, the -- it's interesting, North Carolina -- the authority -- authoritative body said that they will meet by -- by December 21st, and I don't know -- could be tomorrow, but by December 21st, to make -- to put forth their view of it.

What are their options? They could certify the election; they could call for a new election, which would be of the same parties in the general election, within 75 days; or they could just throw the whole thing out and say, "We're starting from scratch." There are some of the options.

I don't think the option of a recount is as -- a lively one as we thought it might have been earlier. But anyways, those are the three versions.

The House still retains the right to decide who is seated. That is one of the powers of the House of Representatives, it controls who can be seated in the -- in the Congress. So this -- any member-elect can object to the seating of -- the swearing in of another member-elect and we'll see how that goes.

As you know, it's not just the Democrats who have a problem with how it went in North Carolina. The Republicans have a problem too because it affected their primary election, the fraud that exists there.

So House Admin will have full -- the House Administration Committee will have full investigative authority to determine the winner of the election. And again, it -- only if it's impossible to determine who the winner is would we take the extraordinary step of calling for new elections. But that governing body can do so.

So we're all in a close touch on that because this is bigger than that one seat, this is about undermining the integrity of our elections. And what was done there is so remarkable, (inaudible) that person -- those entities got away with that, even to the detriment of the Republicans in the primary.

Now, the issue in Florida is one that we're tracking, as well.

Then -- then -- to add insult to injury about what the Republicans did in these races, the -- they are now challenging the seating of our member in Maine, saying that they're questioning the -- the process.

PELOSI:  But, you know, they have ranked voting, which has been voted on twice by the people of Maine as the -- as their method of having an election, and now the Republicans are saying, "Well" -- there's even a question as to the constitutionality of rank voting, in their view. But if they had won, of course, there'd be no question about the constitutionality of it.

So we're operating on three fronts.

(CROSSTALK)

PELOSI:  Yes, I think some...

QUESTION:  I -- I just want to ask about -- you said you would accept the C.R. for DHS.

PELOSI:  Yes.

QUESTION:  Are you looking for a C.R. into the early part of the year? Are you looking for a full year of C.R.?

PELOSI:  Oh, a full year, a full year.

QUESTION:  A full year. So you don't want to have this fight again in January, basically is what you're saying.

PELOSI:  No, no, a full year. No, there's no point in doing that.

But even if you have a C.R. for a full year, it doesn't mean that at some point, if you come to another conclusion, you can pass a bill. But you have to -- you can't do this (inaudible). I mean, there's too much uncertainty involved in (inaudible)

(CROSSTALK)

QUESTION:  May I follow up on his question?

PELOSI:  Sure.

(CROSSTALK)

QUESTION:  To follow up on his question, very quickly, some of your -- some of the House Democrats are concerned about adding more money for this border fence. And if you guys do a C.R., my understanding is that that would approve $1.3, at least, million for the border fence, correct? And...

PELOSI:  No, not necessarily.

QUESTION:  Because that's what it was last year, so if you just extend that again, wouldn't that...

PELOSI:  No, no.

QUESTION:  ... cause a problem?

PELOSI:  I mean, it depends on how you spend the money. It's border security. It's about border security.

QUESTION:  But within that, there was money for the fence, as well.

PELOSI:  Well, you're talking about (ph) a fence. You're not talking about a wall now.

QUESTION:  But you're OK with that, as long as it's...

PELOSI:  No, I'm -- I'm -- I'm OK with what our -- our -- our chairwoman, Lucille Roybal-Allard -- she is a person who has fought on these issues her -- her entire stay in Congress, which has been for a couple of decades. We're blessed that she's in the position that she is in.

She knows that we -- most of us, speaking for myself, consider the wall immoral, ineffective and expensive. And the president said he promised it. He also promised Mexico would pay for it. So even if they did, it's immoral still, and then they're not going to pay for it.

So that's -- that isn't -- that isn't -- that isn't how I would interpret a congression -- a continuing resolution.

The -- we -- we can move forward with this. We have a responsibility, all of us, to secure our borders, north, south, and coming in by plane, on our coasts -- three coasts, north, south and west. And that -- that's a responsibility we honor, but we do so by honoring our values, as well.

Thank you all very much.

[*]      OPERATOR:  Good afternoon. My name is Jacqueline (ph), and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the National Health Expenditures Report Release Conference Call. All lines have been places on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key. Thank you.

Kelly Ceballos, you may begin your conference.

CEBALLOS:  Hi, everybody. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining our call. I just want to go over a few housekeeping items for this call.

This is going to be a technical press call, embargoed -- all information here today is embargoed until 4 o'clock on December 6th, this afternoon. Questions can go ahead and be focused on the 2017 National Health Expenditures Report released today by the Office of the Actuary.

I wanted to invite Alan Weil and Sue Ducat of Health Affairs to make a couple of brief comments.

WEIL:  Thank you, Kelly. This is Alan Weil; I'm Editor-in-Chief of Health Affairs. We're thrilled to be able to release at 4 o'clock today the National Health Spending data for 2017.

We are continuing our partnership with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Offices of the Actuary. This is consistently one of our most highly cited papers each year, and we are confident that you will find this year's information as interesting and important as in prior years.

We do, as many of you know, typically have an in-person briefing on this. We were unable to do it this year due to the federal government's closure yesterday, but we hope that this conversation today will meet your needs in terms of getting the questions you might have about the material answered. So with, again, thanks to the CMS team, we're very pleased to be the home for this critical annual report on how much the nation is spending on healthcare.

I'm going to turn it to Sue Ducat, who's -- will go through a couple of basic logistics from a Health Affairs perspective, and then you'll hear from the authors of the report themselves. Sue?

DUCAT:  Thank you, Alan, and I echo my thanks to the CMS team.

Just a reminder that this study is embargoed until 4 o'clock Eastern Time. If you would like an advance copy of the study, send me an email at S-D-U-C-A-T at ProjectHope dot org. That's S-D-U-C-A-T at ProjectHope dot org, and I will share it with you. Thank you.

Kelly?

CEBALLOS:  Thanks, guys.

Just for your records today, joining the call are the authors of the report. The main author will do the presentation this afternoon; her name is Anne Martin. Also with her are Aaron Catlin, Micah Hartman, and Benjamin Washington. They will help answer questions as well. After the presentation on the findings and highlights of today's report, we will take questions.

But with that, I'm going to let Anne go ahead and begin.

Anne?

MARTIN:  Thank you, Kelly. Hello. My name is Anne Martin. I'm presenting the National Health Expenditures Report for 2017, and I'm going to be speaking from the briefing slides that you were all provided a copy of.

So to start with, some of the main points found on the overview slide, total healthcare spending reached $3.5 trillion, or $10,739 per person in 2017. This was an increase of 3.9 percent from the total level of spending in 2016, but a slower rate of growth than in 2016, when healthcare spending increased 4.8 percent.

The share of the total economy measured by GDP devoted to healthcare spending was 17.9 percent in 2017. This share remained relatively stable from 2016, when it was 18 percent. Growth slowed among almost all payers, sponsors, and healthcare services. And finally the main reason for the deceleration in growth was the slowdown in the use and intensity of services or the quantity and mix of services, particularly for hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs, which are the three largest categories that make up (63 percent) of total healthcare spending.

On slide three, we have growth in national health expenditures and growth in gross domestic product, as well as national health spending as a share of gross domestic product. And growth in healthcare spending in 2017, at 3.9 percent, was the slowest rate of growth since 2013, when it was 3 percent, and it was the second consecutive year of slowing growth. As the rate of healthcare spending slowed, overall economic growth accelerated in 2017.

Total gross domestic product increased 4.2 percent in 2017, accelerating from growth of 2.7 percent in 2016. Although healthcare spending grew slightly more slowly than GDP in 2017, their growth rates converged, leading to a 17.9 percent health spending share of GDP, which was similar to the 18 percent share in 2016 (ph).

On slide four, we list the main drivers of growth starting with 2014 and 2015 through 2017. So the slowdown that began in 2016 followed elevated rates of growth in 2014 and 2015 when health spending growth averaged 5.5 percent. These two years saw dramatic increases in health insurance enrollment as major provisions of the Affordable Care Act expanded insurance options particularly for private health insurance and Medicaid leading to an increase in the use and intensity of services.

Additionally, retail prescription drug spending growth was very strong due mainly to an increase in spending for Hepatitis C medications. As the initial impacts of expanded enrollment subsided and as spending for Hepatitis C drugs declined as more patients became cured of the disease, overall healthcare spending growth slowed in 2016 to 4.8 percent and again in 2017 to 3.9 percent.

A deceleration in the use and intensity of services particularly for hospital care positioning clinical services and retail prescription drugs was a primary contributor to the overall slowdown in 2017.

On slide five, we break down the factors accounting for growth and per capita in national health expenditures for selected calendar years 2004 through 2017. On a per capita basis, national health spending grew 3.2 percent compared to growth of 4 percent in 2016.

In breaking down the factors that account for growth and per capital health spending, there was a slowdown in the use and intensity in 2017, which is the green portion of the bar (where) at the same time there was faster growth in medical prices, which is the blue portion of the bar.

The age and gender portion of the increase in healthcare spending is the red portion of the bar and that stays relatively stable from year to year and increased 0.5 percent in 2017. In 2017, residual use and intensity increase 1.1 percent, which was slower than the increase of 2.1 percent in 2016.

This was the main factor contributing to the slowdown in per capita health spending in 2017 and was the continuation of the slowdowns that began in 2016 as a result of slower growth and enrollment in private health insurance and Medicaid after the initial impacts of coverage expansion as well as less use of high cost specialty drugs such as for Hepatitis C.

In 2107 medical prices grew 1.6 percent compared to 1.3 percent growth in 2016 and accounted for a larger proportion of total per capita healthcare spending. On slide six, we show annual growth and spending by type of good and service for 2016 compared to 2017.

There was slower growth in almost all goods and services in 2017 compared to 2016 including for the three largest services; hospitals, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs.

Spending for hospital care, which accounted for 33 percent of total healthcare spending, experienced growth of 4.6 percent in 2017. This was slower than growth of 5.6 percent in 2016 and reflected slower growth in the use and intensity of services as growth in outpatient visit slowed while growth in inpatient days (ph) increased at about the same rate in 2016 and 2017.

Position and clinical services spending accounted for 20 percent of total healthcare spending and increased 4.2 percent in 2017. This was a slower rate of growth than in 2016 when spending increased 5.6 percent and was a result of a deceleration in the use and intensity of services as price growth accelerated in 2017.

Spending for retail prescription drugs accounted for 10 percent of total national healthcare spending and increased at its slowest rate since 2012 at 0.4 percent. This marked the third consecutive year of slowing growth and retail prescription drug spending.

Spending increased rapidly in 2014 due to increased spending on new medicines particularly those used to treat Hepatitis C that has subsided as many patients have become cured of the disease. Other factors contributing to slower growth in retail prescription drug spending in 2017 includes slower growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed, a continued shift to lower cost generic drugs, and a slow down in price growth.

On slide seven, we look at annual growth and spending by source of fund for the two years, 2016 and 2017. There was also slower growth among most payers in 2017. Spending for the largest payer of healthcare, private health insurance, which accounted for 34 percent of total healthcare spending increased 4.2 percent in 2017. This was slower than the 6.2 percent rate of growth in 2016 and was influenced by slower growth in medical benefits and a decline in season (ph) taxes, resulting in the suspension of the health insurance plan C (ph) in 2017.

In addition, slightly slower growth in enrollment contributed to the slowdown in total private health insurance spending. Medicare is the second largest payer category at 20 percent of total healthcare spending, an increased 4.2 percent in 2017. This was a fairly steady rate of growth, as Medicare spending increased 4.3 percent in 2016. Slower growth and fee for service Medicare spending was almost entirely offset by faster growth in spending for Medicare private health plans.

When looked at by type of expenditure, Medicare experienced slower growth in administration and in cost of insurance, hospital care and retail prescription drugs while there was faster growth in physician and clinical services and other professional services. Medicaid, which makes up a 17 percent share of healthcare spending increased 2.9 percent in 2017, slowing from 4.2 percent growth in 2016. The slower growth in total Medicaid expenditures in 2017 was influenced by a deceleration in enrollment growth and a reduction in the Medicaid net cost of health insurance as the federal government recovered payments from managed care organizations based on their favorable prior period performance.

State and local Medicaid expenditures grew 6.4 percent while federal Medicaid expenditures increased just 0.8 percent in 2017, influenced by a requirement for states to fund five percent of the cost of Medicaid expansion in 2017, while in prior years these costs were funded entirely by the federal government.

On slide eight, we're looking at the sponsors of healthcare were (ph) the ultimate financers. Spending by federal government in (ph) households accounted for the largest shares of spending at 28 percent each. Those experienced slower growth in 2017.

For the federal government, growth slowed due primarily to slower growth in federal Medicaid spending, while for households the slowdown was mainly a result of slower growth in out of pocket spending. Spending on healthcare by private businesses, which accounted for a 20 percent share of total healthcare spending, also slowed and was due to a slowdown in private business's contributions to employer-sponsored private health insurance premiums. In contrast, spending for state and local governments, which accounted for a 17 percent share, accelerated in 2017 due to faster growth in state and local Medicaid spending.

That concludes the presentation and we will now open it up for questions. Thank you very much.

CEBALLOS:  Thanks, Anne. Jacqueline (ph), if you want to start the question and answer period, that would be great.

OPERATOR:  Certainly. At this time I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question please press "star" then the number "one" on your telephone keypad. Again, that is "star," "one" on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&amp;A roster.

CEBALLOS:  Ready for the first question, (ph)Jacqueline).

OPERATOR:  Wonderful. The first question comes from Tom Howell from Washington Times. Your line is open.

QUESTION:  Hey, thanks for doing the call. Just had a question about the rate in growth Medicaid. Is it accurate to see this as -- 2017 being a period after many of the states snapped up the ACA dollars for expansion? And is it reasonable to think that maybe the growth will accelerate in future reports? Because it's like Virginia, Maine, some others are now considering expansion once again.

MARTIN:  State and local Medicaid expenditures did accelerate in prior years due to the expansion. We don't have information on data past 2017 at this point.

CAITLIN:  To the extent that there is any future expansion, it will be reflected in our future estimates. Next year we'll be releasing the 2018 data. So to the extent that, in future years, 2019 and on, we will capture that, our office also produces projections of health spending which will be coming out early next year.

CEBALLOS:  Ready for the next question, Jacqueline (ph).

OPERATOR:  The next question comes from Tami Luhby from CNN. Your line is open.

QUESTION:  Thank you for holding the call. So do you have any idea what might -- what might account for the slowdown in usage or intensity? I mean, are Americans getting healthier? That's kind of facetious, but.

MARTIN:  So in our measure of use and intensity is basically a mixture of the quantities and mix of services involved. And it's calculated as a residual which means that we can calculate the growth in total healthcare spending and then we subtract out growth in population, age and gender, composition of the population and price inflation. And so that leaves us with use and intensity.

So it's everything except price and population, and age and gender growth. So it can account for hospitals, for example, it's -- anecdotal evidence shows that outpatient visits slowed. For prescription drugs, we look at number of prescriptions dispensed, and growth slowed in that category as well. So things like inpatient visits, we look at that. That actually did not change in 2017 but it's more the quantities and mix of the services.

QUESTION:  OK. If I have any nitpicky questions, whom can I contact?

MARTIN:  You can e-mail me, Anne dot Martin at CMS dot HHS dot gov.

CEBALLOS:  You can also just write, Tami, to the press office and I'll make sure it gets to her.

QUESTION:  OK, thank you...

CAITLIN:  And just to follow up on that -- just to follow up on that, if you look at the factors accounting for growth slide that Anne covered earlier, you can see in 2014 and 2015 with expansion of coverage through private health insurance and through Medicaid, as well as with the increased spending on new hepatitis C drugs, that there was a large increase in use and intensity and then that comes down in 2016 and 2017 as the impact of both of those subsides.

QUESTION:  OK. Would it be accurate to lump '14, '15, and '16 together as higher growth than 2017, or you really need to specify that the slowdown started in 2016?

CAITLIN:  The impact of use and intensity is higher in -- sort of peaks in 2015 on that chart. And then 2016 begins to slow and it's even slower in 2017.

CEBALLOS:  Next question, please, Jacqueline (ph)...

QUESTION Thank you.

OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Donna Young from S&amp;P Global News. Your line is open.

QUESTION Thank you for taking my question. I actually had a couple. First, last year, you reported that the -- that the spending grew by 4.3 percent in 2016 but this year's report says 4.8 percent in 2016. So if you could explain the difference there. And also, on the drugs, other than the hepatitis C drugs, what were the other ones that accounted for the difference there? And then if you could also maybe comment, I know you said that you only have 2017 figures but are you kind of looking ahead to the difference that gene therapies may make in the spending? Thanks a lot.

MARTIN:  To your first question, we revise our data every year based on the latest available source data and information. And we had a revision in 2016 for health spending. It was revised up by $23.8 billion which caused the growth rate to go from 4.3 percent to 4.8 percent. However, that did not affect the healthcare share of GDP because GDP also had an upwards revision.

As far as your prescription drug spending question, we refer mainly to information that we get from IQVIA on drivers of growth and spending and we don't necessarily have a breakdown in spending by type of drug. But according to that report, the top therapeutic classes in 2017 by spending were diabetes, oncology, autoimmune, respiratory agents, and HIV antivirals. And we don't look forward in this report, so we can't answer your third question. Next question, please, Jacqueline (ph).

OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Cathy Kelly from Pink Sheet Information. Your line is open.

QUESTION:  Thank you. I was wondering if you had information on cost sharing -- or sorry, out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs.

MARTIN:  We do break down our prescription drug spending figures by a type of payer and out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs. Growth slowed for private health insurance and out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs in 2017.

OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from John Tozzi from Bloomberg News. Your line is open.

QUESTION:  Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask. I think, in the projections that CMS released earlier this year, the forecast was for 4.6 percent spending growth in 2017. What differed here from what you guys were forecasting? Are there any sort of trends or things that particularly differed from expectations?

CAITLIN:  Yes, that's correct. You have the right projection number for health spending that we released last year. In general, the estimates were very similar. When you look at it in aggregate, we're showing 3.9. As you mentioned, they're showing 4.6.

Some of the differences in the underlying estimates, where we show different trends that have been in historical data than we showed earlier with the projections, were in private health insurance, Medicare and in our retail prescription drug estimate.

So there are very similar tables in the projection's article that we published, so the ones that are in the historical article that we're going to release this afternoon, so you can make that detailed comparison.

MARTIN:  Next question, please.

OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Kimberly Leonard from Washington Examiner. Your line is open.

QUESTION:  Hi, I missed meeting with you all in person at the press club. I was looking at the report and I noticed one of the sections talks about, when it comes to drug pricing, the reduction in drugs that treat pain. So I was wondering whether the attention around the opioid epidemic might be a part of that.

And then if you'll allow me a second question. It looks as though the reduction in drug spending had more to do with people using -- they're taking fewer prescription drugs rather than list prices going down. Thanks so much.

MARTIN:  Yes, the number of prescriptions dispensed did slow. But price growth actually slowed for brands, and it declined for generics, according to the (inaudible) report. And you're correct, in stating that the number of prescriptions dispensed for pain had a large impact on the trend, and a lot of that did have to do with the opioid epidemic and greater tightening of those type of prescriptions being dispensed.

OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from (inaudible). Your line is open.

QUESTION:  Hi, thanks for the question. A couple of mine already got answered, but I just wanted to follow up quickly. So the reason for the lower intensity of services in hospitals and clinics, is there any indication why that is lower? Are they being diverted elsewhere?

And then just a quick follow up. I think you mentioned the health insurance fee played a role in a private health insurance growth slowing. I'm just wondering if you can get a -- give me a sense of how big a role that played?

MARTIN:  OK. As far as the use and intensity of services, unfortunately, we don't have exact data for that -- for those categories, and can just point to anecdotal evidence based on our methodology. So I don't have an answer on that, too.

QUESTION:  Yes, and in terms of the impact that the health insurance tax fee had, it was a lesser impact on the overall trend, compared to the emphasis of the impact that we're talking about, from a slowdown from benefits -- medical benefits that were paid out. It did play a role, and the moratorium was for 2017. So the fee's expected to come back after 2017, but we don't have it quantified in our -- in our numbers.

OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Ellie Kincaid from Forbes Media. Your line is open.

QUESTION:  Thank you. I wanted to ask if with this data you have any sense of the role of high deductable health plans in these trends. I know you said there's not really much -- it seems like there's not really much more you can say about what slows down use and intensity. But just wanted to know what role high deductible health plans are playing.

HARTMAN:  The prevalence of high deductible health plans has been on the rise in recent years. In 2017, there was not much change compared to 2016 from the reports that we have looked at. But it basically has become a very large share of enrollment of health insurance plans.

If you look back over the past four to five years, somewhere between 20 and 30 percent of enrollment is in high deductible health plans. To the extent that there's lots of studies out there that discuss the impacts of enrollment and high deductible health plans and higher cautionary exposure that we have cited in the past in previous articles that can play a role on utilization healthcare services.

OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Rachel Roubein from Politico. Your line is open.

QUESTION:  Hi, thanks for taking my question. I noticed in the report that is talk a little bit about the dip in -- or the percentage of Americans having health insurance from 91.1 percent in 2016 to 90.9 percent in 2017.

So I was sort of wondering if you could sort of expand on that and if that is a reason why the pace of growth (ph) slows for like per capita payments per person or in general and sort of what that means about the use and intensity (ph of healthcare services, how that kind of intertwines?

MARTIN:  You're correct. Uninsured -- or the insured share of (ph) the population was 90.9 percent in 2017. That was a similar share however in 2015 and 2016. That rate actually jumped up from 86 percent in 2013 to 91 percent in 2015 as individuals who previously were not insured either became eligible to join Medicaid or enrolled in marketplace plans. So that's where we saw the biggest jumps in enrollment.

And in 2016 and 2017, we continue to see enrollment increase in Medicaid due to the newly eligible marketplace -- enrollment was about stable. But overall for private health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid, we do continue to see slight increases in enrollment, even though the rate of growth is slowing after the initial impacts in 2014 and 2015 of the expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

So with all that going on, just seeing the insured share of the population remains about stable, we don't -- the one million additional uninsured, it's hard to tell where -- or where they came from or what types of insurance they did or did not have before. But we can't really comment more on that other than to say that that the rate of growth is continuing to slow in enrollment, even though it's still increasing slightly.

OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Bob Herman from Axios. Your line is open.

Bob Herman, your line is open.

QUESTION:  Yes. Hi, sorry. I just want to go back to something -- a previous question talking about the revisions from the February report. Can you explain again that the revision from 4.6 percent to now the 3.9 percent. And I'm just -- and can you also explain how you're getting your economic growth that's in the first paragraph you said that increased 4.2 percent in 2017. I'm not seeing any kind of similar numbers there.

And then finally, can you just -- it seems like all of this, since utilization is down, it's coming back to prices then, right? The hospital doctors, drug companies. The increase in spending, we're still spending $3.5 trillion, is -- it's almost entirely due to price hikes then?

Thanks.

CAITLIN:  OK, I'll start with a little bit more detail on the differences between what we projected for 2017 versus what we're going to release today, the difference between the 4.6 that was projected in February and the 3.9 percent. When we do the historical estimates for the first time following the projections that come out, we have more complete data and a lot more information to estimate 2017.

One thing to keep in mind is that the 2016 number that we had projected from was 4.3 percent and we've now revised that up with more complete data and information for 2016 so that it's 4.8 percent. So one issue is that we had projected off of a lower (grade growth) rate in the prior year, but it just -- it reflects a more complete information that's available, whereas a large portion of 2017 was projected when we came out with the report in February.

Economic growth that we cite is nominal GDP; a lot of what you see in the media and is reported is real GDP. So that could be the difference in the GDP that we're showing and what you may have expected to see.

OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from (inaudible) from (inaudible). Your line is open.

QUESTION:  Hi there, thank you for taking my question. I just have one, if you could give a little more context to the slowing rate -- on slowing growth of out of pocket spending, I'm curious what contributed to that?

MARTIN:  Out of pocket spending grew 2.6 percent and that's slowing from 4.4 percent in 2016. Out of pocket spending for most healthcare goods and services slowed in 2017 in particular for nursing care facilities, prescription drugs, other non-durables and other professional services. And we don't really have information on drivers of out of pocket spending.

OPERATOR:  And your final question, it comes from Joyce Frieden from MedPage Today. Your line is open.

QUESTION:  Yes, hi, thank you. I was curious about the slow down in the growth in physician and clinical services spending; you said it was deceleration of growth in the use and intensity. I wondered if you could tie that to anything else, like higher enrollment in high deductable health plans so that people are more cautious about spending money on these visits?

And also wanted to clarify who was speaking besides Anne for some of these answers?

CAITLIN:  OK, I know I'd answered some of the questions, this is Aaron Catlin.

HARTMAN:  And this was Micah Hartman.

CAITLIN:  When you're looking at the drivers for physician and clinical services, I think there are a number of factors that could impact that trend that we don't specifically estimate levels for. You'd mentioned high deductable health plans, which would affect physicians and clinics as well as other services. There's the shift in site (ph) of care, as you have services that were traditionally consumed in other settings, being concerned -- being consumed in clinical and freestanding settings that they weren't previously.

So what we -- what we -- what we can tell you is that the price growth had increased slightly in 2017 for physician and clinics, and so the indications are that use and intensity had slowed.

CEBALLOS:  Thanks, everybody. So this is Kelly from CMS. Thanks for all your great questions.

I wanted to thank our speakers and remind everybody that the -- all the information on this call and the slides, and materials you were sent are embargoed until 4 o'clock today, and also if you have remaining questions you can certainly e-mail the press box which is press at CMS HHS dot gov.

And finally for those who needed additional details on the names of all the authors, and who were on this call -- those were in the (media advisory) that was sent out for this call.

Sue, did you want to give another reminder for folks to e-mail you too?

DUCAT:  Sure. If you still need a copy of the study, please feel free to e-mail me at S-D-U-C-A-T at ProjectHope dot org. Thank you very much.

CEBALLOS:  Thanks, everyone. Have a great day.

OPERATOR:  This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

"At least we have one thing on our side-Stein's law, named after the famous economist Herbert Stein: 'If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.'"

PERHAPS the most astonishing thing about modern medicine is just how very modem it is. More than 90% of the medicine being practiced today did not exist in 1950. Two centuries ago, medicine still was an art, not a science at all. As recently as the 1920s, long after the birth of modem medicine, there usually was little the medical profession could do, once disease set in, other than alleviate some of the symptoms and let nature take its course. It was the patient's immune system that cured him-or that did not

It only was around 1930 that the power of the doctor to cure and ameliorate disease began to increase substantially, and that power has continued to grow nearly exponentially ever since. This new power to extend life, interacting with the deepest instinctual impulse of all living things-to stay alive-has had consequences that our society only is beginning to comprehend and address. Since ancient times, for example, doctors have fought death with all of the power at their disposal and for as long as life remained. Today, the power to heal has become so mighty that we increasingly have the technical means to extend indefinitely the shadow, while often not the substance, of life. When doctors should cease their efforts and allow death to have its inevitable victory is an issue that wifi not soon be settled, but it cannot be much longer evaded.

Then there is the question of how to pay for modem medicine, the costs of which are rising faster than any other major national expenditure. hi 1930, Americans spent $2,800,000,000 on health care-$23 per person and 3.5% of the gross domestic product In 2015, we sprat about three trillion dollars-$9,536 per person and 15% of GDP. Adjusted for inflation, this means that per capita medical costs in the U.S. have risen by a factor of 30 in about 90 years.

Consider the 1980s, when medical expenses in the U.S. increased 117%. Forty-three percent of the rise was due to general inflation. Ten percent can be attributed to the American population growing both larger and older (as it still is). Twenty-three percent went to pay for technology, treatments, and pharmaceuticals that had not been available when the decade began-a measure of how fast medicine has been advancing. However, that still leaves 24% of the increase unaccounted for, and that 24% is due solely to an inflation peculiar to the U.S. medical system itself.

Whenever one segment of an economy exhibits, year after year, inflation above the general rate, and when there is no constraint on supply, then either a cartel is in operation or there is a lack of price transparency-or both, as is the case with U.S. medical care.

So, it is clear that there is something terribly wrong with how health care is financed in our country, and a consensus on how to fix the problem-how to provide Americans the best medicine money can buy for the least amount of money that will buy it-has proved elusive. Still, the history of U.S. medical care, considered in the light of some simple but ineluctable economic laws, can help point the way. For it turns out that the engines of medical inflation were deeply, and innocently, inserted into the health-care system just as the medical revolution began.

It was the Greeks-the inventors of the sys- tematic use of reason that 2,000 years later gave rise to modern science-who first recognized that disease is caused by natural, not supernatural, forces. They reduced medicine to a set of principles, usually ascribed to Hippocrates but actually a collective work. In the second century, the Greek physician Galen, a follower of the Hippocratic School, wrote extensively on anatomy and medical treatment. Many of these texts survived and became almost canonical in their influence during the Middle Ages.

So, it is fair to say that, after classical times, the art of medicine largely stagnated. Except for a few drugs-such as quinine and digitalis- and an improved knowledge of gross anatomy, the physicians practicing in the U.S. at the turn of the 19th century had hardly more at their disposal than the Greeks had in ancient times.

In 1850, the U.S. had 40,755 people calling themselves physicians, more per capita than the country would have in 1970. Few of this legion had formal medical education, and many were unabashed charlatans. This is not to say that medical progress was standing still. The stethoscope was invented in 1816. The world's first dental school opened in Baltimore, Md., in 1839. The discovery of anesthesia in the 1840s was immensely important-and, although it made extended operations possible, overwhelming postoperative infections killed many patients, so most surgery remained a last-ditch effort. Another major advance was the spread of clean water supplies in urban areas, greatly reducing epidemics of waterborne diseases, such as typhoid and cholera, which had ravaged cities for centuries.

Then, finally, beginning in the 1850s and 1860s, it was discovered that many diseases were caused by specific microorganisms, as was the infection of wounds, surgical and other. The germ theory of disease, the most-powerful idea in the history of medicine, was bom, and medicine as a science was born with it.

Still, while there was a solid scientific theory underpinning medicine, most of its advances in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were preventive rather than curative. Louis Pasteur and others, using their new knowledge of microorganisms, could begin developing vaccines. Rabies fell in 1885, and several diseases that once were the scourge of childhood, such as whooping cough and diphtheria, followed around the turn of the century.

Vitamin deficiency diseases, such as pellagra, began to decline a decade later. When the pasteurization of milk began to be widely mandated around that time, the death rate among young children plunged. In 1891, the death rate for American children in the first year of life was 125.1 per 1,000. By 1925, it had been reduced to 15.8 per 1,000, and the life expectancy of Americans as a whole began a dramatic rise.

One of the most-fundamental changes caused by the germ theory of disease, one not foreseen at all, was the spread of hospitals for treating the sick. Hospitals have an ancient history but, for most of that history, they were intended for the very poor, especially those who were mentally ill or blind or who suffered from contagious diseases such as leprosy. Anyone who could afford better was treated at home or in nursing facilities operated by a private physician.

Worse, until rigorous antiseptic and later aseptic procedures were adopted, hospitals were a prime factor in spreading, not curing, disease. Thus, until the late 19th century, hospitals were little more than a place for the poor and the desperate to die. In 1873, there were 149 hospitals in the entire U.S. A century later, there were more than 7,000, and they had become the cutting edge of both clinical medicine and medical research.

However, hospitals had a financial problem from the very beginning of scientific medicine. By their nature, they are extremely labor intensive and expensive to operate. Moreover, their costs are relatively fixed and not dependent on the number of patients being served. To help solve this problem, someone in the late 1920s had a bright idea: hospital insurance. The first hospital plan was introduced in Dallas, Texas, in 1929. The subscribers, some 1,500 school teachers, paid six dollars a year in premiums, and Baylor University Hospital agreed to provide up to 21 days of care to any subscriber who needed it.

While this protected school teachers from unexpected costs in exchange for a modest fee, the driving purpose behind the idea was to improve the cash flow of the hospital. Thus, the scheme had an immediate appeal to other medical institutions, and it spread quickly. Before long, groups of hospitals were banding together to offer plans that were honored at all participating institutions, giving subscribers a choice of which hospital to use. This became the model for Blue Cross, which first operated in Sacramento, Calif., in 1932.

Although called insurance, these hospital plans were unlike any other insurance policies. Previously, insurance always had been used to protect only against large, unforeseeable losses, and came with a deductible, but the first hospital plans did not work that way. Instead of protecting against catastrophe, they paid all costs up to a certain limit. The reason, of course, is that they were instituted not by insurance companies, but by hospitals, and primarily were designed to generate steady demand for hospital services and guarantee a regular cash flow.

In the early days of hospital insurance, this fundamental defect was hardly noticeable. Twenty-one days was a very long hospital stay, even in 1929, and with the relatively primitive medical technology then available, the daily cost of hospital care per patient was roughly the same whether the patient had a baby, a bad back, or a brain tumor.

Today, on the other hand, this "front-end" type of hospital insurance simply would not cover what most of us need insurance against: the serious, long-term, expensive-to-cure illness. In the 1950s, major medical insurance, which does protect against catastrophe rather than misfortune, began to provide that sort of coverage, although it did not replace the old plans in most cases, but instead supplementedD them.

The original hospital insurance also contained the seeds of two other major economic dislocations, unnoticed in the beginning, that have come to loom large. The first is that, while people purchased hospital plans to be protected against unpredictable medical expenses, the plans only paid off if the medical expenses were incurred in a hospital. As a result, cases that could be treated on an outpatient basis instead became much more likely to be treated in the hospital-the most-expensive form of medical care.

The second dislocation was that hospital insurance did not provide indemnity coverage, which is when the insurance company pays for a loss and the customer decides how best to deal with it. Rather than indemnification, the insurance company provided service benefits. In other words, it paid the bill for services covered by the policy, whatever the bill was. As a result, there was little incentive for the consumer of medical services to shop around. With someone else paying, patients quickly became relatively indifferent to the cost of medical care.

These dislocations perfectly suited the hospitals, which wanted to maximize the amount of services they provided and thereby maximize their cash flow. If patients are indifferent to the costs of medical services they buy, they are much more likely to buy more of them and the cost of each service is likely to go up. There is no price competition to keep prices in check.

Predictably, the medical profession began to lobby in favor of retaining this system. In the mid 1930s, as Blue Cross plans spread rapidly around the country, state insurance departments moved to regulate them and force them to adhere to the same standards as regular insurance plans. Had hospital insurance come to be regulated like other insurance, those offering it would have begun acting more like insurance companies, and the economic history of modern American medicine might have taken a very different turn, but that did not happen, largely because doctors and hospitals, by and for whom the plans had been devised in the first place, moved to prevent it from happening. The American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association worked hard to exempt Blue Cross from most insurance regulation, offering in exchange to enroll anyone who applied and to operate on a nonprofit basis.

The Internal Revenue Service, meanwhile, ruled that these companies were charitable organizations and thus exempt from Federal taxes. Freed from taxes and from the regulatory requirement to maintain large reserve funds, Blue Cross and Blue Shield (a plan that paid physicians' fees on the same basis as Blue Cross paid hospital costs) came to dominate the maricet in health-care insurance, holding about half of the policies outstanding by 1940.

In order to compete, private insurance companies were forced to model their policies along Blue Cross and Blue Shield lines. Thus, hospitals came to be paid almost always on a costplus basis, receiving the cost of the services provided plus a percentage to cover the costs of invested capital. Any incentive for hospitals to be efficient and reduce costs vanished.

In recent years, hospital use has been falling steadily as the population has gotten ever more healthy and surgical procedures have become far less traumatic. The result is a steady increase in empty beds. There were more than 7,000 hospitals in the U.S. in 1975, compared to about 5,500 today, but that reduction has not been nearly enough. Because of the cost-plus way hospitals are paid, they do not compete for patients by means of price, which would force them to retrench and specialize. Instead they compete for docto referrals, and doctors want lots of empty beds to ensure immediate admission and lots of fancy equipment, even if the hospital just down the block has exactly the same equipment The inevitable result, of course, is that hospital costs on a per-patient per-day basis have skyrocketed.

Doctors, meanwhile, were paid for their services according to "reasonable and customary" charges. In other words, doctors could bill whatever they wanted to as long as others were charging roughly the same. The incentive to tack a few dollars on to the fee became strong. The incentive to take a few dollars off, in order to increase market share, ceased to exist. As more and more Americans came to be covered by health insurance, doctors no longer were even able to compete with one another.

During World War ?, another feature of the U.S. health-care system with large financial implications for the future developed: employer-paid health insurance. With 12,000,000 working-age men in the armed forces and the economy in overdrive, the American labor market was tight in the extreme, but wartime wage and price controls prevented companies from competing for available talent by means of increased wages and salaries. They had to compete with fringe benefits instead, and free health insurance was tailor-made for this purpose.

The IRS ruled that the cost of employee health-care insurance was a tax-deductible business expense and, in 1948, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that health benefits were subject to collective bargaining. Companies had no choice but to negotiate with unions about them, and unions fought hard to get them.

The problem was that company-paid health insurance further increased the distance between the consumer of medical care and the purchaser of medical care. When individuals have to pay for their own health insurance, they at least have an incentive to buy the most costeffective plan available, given their particular circumstances. Yet, beginning in the 1940s, a rapidly increasing number of Americans had no rational choice but to take whatever healthcare plan their employers chose to provide.

There is another aspect of employer-paid health insurance, unimagined when the system first began, that has had pernicious economic consequences in recent years. Insurers base the rates they charge, naturally enough, on the total claims they expect to incur. Auto insurers determine this by looking at what percentage of a community's population had auto accidents in recent years and how much repairs cost in that community. This is known as community rating. They also look at the individual driver's record, the so-called experience rating.

Most insurance policies are based on a combination of community and experience ratings and, for most forms of insurance, the size of the community that is rated is quite large, eliminating the statistical anomalies that skew small samples. For instance, a person is not penalized because he happens to live on a block with a lot of lousy drivers, but employer-paid health insurance is an exception. It can be based on the data for each company's employees, allowing insurance companies to cherry-pick businesses with healthy employees, driving up the cost of insurance for everyone else. The effects of this practice are clear: 65% of workers without health insurance work for companies with 25 or fewer employees.

By 1960, as the medical revolution was gaining speed quickly, the economically flawed private health-care financing system fully was in place. Then two other events added to the gathering debacle.

In 1965, government entered the medical market with Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor. Both doctors and hospitals had fought tooth and nail to prevent what they called "socialized medicine" from gaining a foothold in the U.S. As a result of their strident opposition, when the two programs finally were enacted, they were structured much like Blue Cross and Blue Shield, only with government picking up much of the tab.

When Medicare and Medicaid proved a bonanza for health-care providers, their vehement opposition quickly faded away. The two new systems greatly increased the number of people who could afford advanced medical care, and the incomes of medical professionals soared, roughly doubling in the 1960s, but perhaps the most-important consequence of these new programs was the power over hospitals they gave to state governments, which became the largest single source of funds for virtually every major hospital in the country, giving litem the power to influence-or even dictate-the policy decisions made by these hospitals.

As a result, these decisions increasingly were made for political, rather than medical or economic, reasons. To take one example, closing surplus hospitals or converting them to specialized treatment centers became much more difficult. Those adversely affected-the local neighborhood and hospital workers unions- naturally would mobilize to prevent it. Society as a whole, which stood to gain, would not.

Finally, there was the litigation explosion of the last 50 years. For every medical malpractice suit filed in the U.S. in 1969, 300 were filed in 1990. While reforms at the state level (notably in Texas) have reduced the number, lawsuits have driven up the cost of malpractice insurance sharply-a cost passed directly on to patients and their insurance companies. Neurosurgeons, even with excellent records, can pay as much as $300,000 a year for coverage. Doctors in less lawsuit-prone specialties also are paying much higher premiums and are forced to order unnecessary tests and perform unnecessary procedures to avoid being second-guessed in court.

Given this short history, it followed as the night follows day that medical costs began to rise over and above inflation, population growth, and the cost of medical advances. The results for the country as a whole are plain to see. In 1930, we spent 3.5% of GDP on health care; in 1950, 4.5%; in 1970, 7.3%; in 1990, 12.2%. Today, we spend 15%. U.S. medical care over this period has saved the lives of millions who could not have been saved before-life expectancy today is 78.6 years. It has relieved the pain and suffering of tens of millions more, but it also has become a monster that is devouring the U.S. economy.

Is there a solution?

Is there a way out? One possible answer, certainly, is a national health care service, such as that pioneered in Great Britain after World War II, but our Federal government already runs three single-payer systems-Medicare, the Veterans Health Administration, and the Indian Health Service-each of which is in a shambles, noted for fraud, waste, and corruption. Why would we want to turn over all of American medicine to those who have proved themselves incompetent to run large parts of it?

A far better and less-expensive alternative would be to reform the economics of the present system. The most-important thing to do, by far, is to require medical service providers to make public their inclusive prices for all procedures. Most hospitals keep their prices hidden in order to charge more when they can, such as with the uninsured, but some facilities do post their prices. The Surgery Center of Oklahoma, for instance, does so on its website. A knee replacement there will cost you $15,499; mastectomy, $6,505; rotator cuff repair $8,260.

Once prices are known and can be compared, competition-capitalism's secret weapon-immediately will drive prices towards the low end, draining hundreds of billions of dollars in excess charges out of the system. Posting prices also will force hospitals to become more efficient and innovative in order to stay competitive.

Any politician who pontificates about reforming health care without talking about making prices public is carrying water for one or more of the powerful lobbyists that have stymied real reform, such as the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, and the health workers unions.

Second, we should reform how malpractice is handled. We should get rid of the socalled American rule, where both sides pay their own legal expenses regardless of outcome, and adopt the English rule-employed in the rest of the common-law world-where the loser pays the expenses of both sides.

Third, we need to ensure that the consumers of medical care-you and me-care about the cost of medical care. Getting patients to shop for lower-cost services is vital.

A generous health insurance policy more or less covers everything from a sniffle to a heart transplant. It should not. An insurance policy that covers routine care is not even an insurance policy, properly speaking-it is a very expensive pre-payment plan that jacks up premiums. Just as oil changes are not covered by automobile insurance, annual flu shots and scraped knees should not be covered by medical insurance.

One way to achieve this would be for employers to provide major medical insurance plus a health savings account to take care of routine health care. If the money in the account is not spent on health care, it would be rolled over into the employee's 401(k) account at the end of the year, giving that individual an incentive to shop wisely for routine medical care.

Finally, we need to get the practitioners of modern medicine to recognize an age-old reality: there is no cure for old age itself. Maybe someday we will be able to 3D print a new body and have the data in our brain downloaded to it but, for the time being, when the body begins to break down systemically, we should let nature take its course.

There are enormous forces arrayed against these economically sensible reforms. Defenders of the status quo are the most-potent lobbyists in Washington and the state capitals-and then there are the leftist proponents of single payer, who favor whatever will increase the power and scope of government. So, it will not be an easy fight, but at least we have one thing on our side-Stein's law, named after the famous economist Herbert Stein: "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop." â

The Trump administration insists rebates cause inflated prices. What would it mean to physicians and patients if the system ended?

Earlier this year, a Senate committee held a hearing to review the Trump administration's plan to lower drug costs, with Alex Azar, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, testifying that pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are to blame for the high prices.

As part of his written testimony, Azar said that since PBMs are paid based on the number of rebates they negotiate, the possibility exists for them to retaliate against manufacturers who cut prices by dropping them from formularies or placing them on a higher tier. "We may need to move toward a system without rebates, where PBMs and drug companies just negotiate fixed-price contracts," he said. "Such a system's incentives, detached from artificial list prices, would likely serve patients far better, as would a system where PBMs receive no compensation from the very pharma companies they're supposed to be negotiating against."

This, he said, would prevent PBMs from impacting prices, as a major criticism of the current system is that PBMs keep some of the rebates instead of passing them to consumers in the form of lower out-of-pocket costs.

The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), a national organization representing America's pharmacy benefit managers, strongly disagrees with this position. A recent study, "Reconsidering Drug Prices, Rebates, and PBMs," conducted by the healthcare consulting service Visante, shows that pharmaceutical manufacturers set prices unrelated to the rebates they negotiate with PBMs.

"Drug companies keep raising prices even when rebates go down," Mark Merritt, PCMAs president and CEO, said in a press release. "Simply eliminating plans' ability to negotiate price concessions would enrich drugmakers at the expense of patients, who'd not only face higher prices but higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs, too"

Furthermore, he says, PBMs have long encouraged manufacturers to offer payers alternative ways to reduce net costs, so the easiest solution is for drug companies to lower their prices.

Research by Express Scripts, a PBM based in St. Louis, shows prescription drug prices continue to rise, with the median price of brand medications increasing 232 percent from 2008 through 2017.

Perry Cohen, PharmD, CEO of the Pharmacy Group, a consultant to healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and organizations, says consumers are just looking to pay a fair price for the value of a drug. Therefore, he says, if price fixing or anything else "fishy" is going on, the government should play a role in fixing it.

"The Trump administration has looked at it and said drugs are too expensive and they want to make them less expensive for the voting citizen," Cohen says. "The big questions everyone is asking now are if their plan will make it better or worse for physicians or better or worse for patients."

IMPACT ON PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS

Todd Edgar, PharmD, senior vice president, payer access solutions for the consulting firm Precision for Value in Gladstone, N.J., says the administration's goal is to remove the safe harbor protection for rebates, with the ultimate objective of eliminating them entirely.

"The goal is to drive the discount down to the consumer," he says. "The rationale is that the consumer doesn't benefit a whole lot from the rebates, and the entities tasked with controlling costs earn more rebate on a higher-priced drug."

Edgar notes that patients who pay a fixed co-pay, initially wouldn't see a change, but those who pay a co-insurance or a percentage of the drug cost could see a significant benefit if the rebate system ends. He cites an example of a hepatitis C patient who pays 25 percent of a $30,000 prescription, but if rebates were to end, would pay 25 percent of a $15,000 prescription.

The problem with this, Edgar adds, is that if rebates are no longer available as a revenue source for the PBMs and insurers, they would probably charge more for services they provided free in the past. Insurers could also raise co-pays and premiums to make up for the lost revenue.

In addition, Edgar says, ending rebates could result in a change in formularies and what preferred medications physicians would prescribe. Still, Edgar says, formularies change annually anyway, so he doesn't see a huge change for physicians if rebates were eliminated.

"Formularies would stay in place, utilization management would stay in place, so there's no less burden for the physician as far as writing drugs for their patients," he says. "Rebates from a financial position have never touched physicians, so there's no good or bad from that perspective."

Meanwhile, Cohen says, the patient will be more aware of what they are actually paying for a drug.

Jennifer Luddy, a spokesperson for Express Scripts, says a simple solution for high drug costs, and one the company endorses, is for pharmaceutical companies to lower their list prices, rather than offering rebates.

Edgar warns that this is just one approach to the problem and the medical industry as a whole should consider several approaches and quantify them before following through with a plan.

Meanwhile, a study, "Drug Rebates Do Not Increase Costs to Consumers," published in May from the University of Illinois, concludes that abolishing the rebate system would not lower drug prices, and may only be replaced by a more complex system.

Study author Anthony T. Lo Sasso, PhD, professor in health policy and administration at Univeristy of Illinois-Chicago and executive director of the American Society of Health Economists, concludes that blaming high drug prices on manufacturer rebates misconstrues the nature of the market for prescription drugs.

"We submit that these rebates are the product of a healthy negotiating process between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, one that serves to inject a modicum of market discipline into a market where it would be otherwise absent," he wrote in the study. "We see no reason that abolishing such a system would result in lower drug prices, and suggest that the most likely outcome from such a prohibition would be another, more convoluted system that imprecisely replicated the rebate system."

HIGHLIGHTS

** The Trump administration argues that rebates to PBMs make drugs more expensive for patients. The PBMs disagree, saying that recent studies show drug manufacturers set prices independent of the rebates.

** Industry experts say ending rebates could result in a change in formularies and what preferred medications physicians would prescribe.

"We may need to move toward a system without rebates, where PBMs and drug companies just negotiate fixed-price contracts. Such a system's incentives, detached from artificial list prices, would likely serve patients far better."

How practices can benefit from data-driven patient care

As both public and private payers focus more on value-based care, population health management has become more common as providers take a more proactive approach to caring for patients.

And while definitions vary, experts agree that population health management is about going beyond the walls of the practice to improve patient health, with the ultimate goals of better quality scores for providers and fewer longterm issues for patients, especially those with chronic conditions.

"Population health is about no longer just treating the patients who walked in the door to see you today" says Christina Taylor, MD, an internist and chief quality officer at The Iowa Clinic in Des Moines, Iowa, where she also serves as director of the population health, quality analytics and care management team. "Whether the patients choose to come to you for care or visit other [primary care] providers, you are responsible for their healthcare and outcomes"

This requires an approach to managing patients that many primary care physicians are not used to, as well as investments in technology and personnel that smaller practices may struggle with, but solutions are available. Data analysis and social determinants become as important as mammograms and diabetic eye exams as value-based care drives demand for more population health analyses to manage costs.

"For folks on the frontlines, population health is an explicit recognition that delivery of care is only 20 percent of the story" says David Nash, MD, MBA, an internist and dean of the Jefferson College of Population Health. He adds that linking physician income to performance measures at the population level is leaving doctors little choice other than to implement it.

Nash predicts that small practices eventually will be forced to incorporate population health, either because of the elimination of exemptions in the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) or the demands of commercial insurers who also want to pay for healthy outcomes and not just patient volume.

"If CMS doesn't get you, Aetna and Anthem will," he says.

While payers see the cost benefits to population health, providers have seen it make a difference in the health of their patients. Anuradha Phadke, MD, an internist and director of population health at Stanford Health Care, says Stanford's efforts have improved patient care and freed up doctor time to focus on the most serious cases.

"For instance, we've been able to identify which patients are poorly controlled diabetics and connect them to resources who reach out and help them bring it under control," says Phadke. "It makes it easier for us to get the desired action by the patient without the clinician spending their time."

Taylor says outreach to remind patients of annual physicals, vaccines, and cancer screenings are all examples of how patients benefit. "It's all about a stronger emphasis on preventative medicine and making sure these appointments happen" says Taylor. "You have to view it as your responsibility to shepherd patients to make sure they get checkups and preventive care."

Some doctors have seen population health management in a negative light, because it requires an emphasis on healthier behaviors. These physicians view that as being beyond their influence.

"As physicians, we can tell people to move more and eat less, but we can't force them to be healthy" says Taylor. "That may all be true, but it is still our responsibility to try, and if we continue to try, we will reach some."

Preventative care and value-based care are closely linked, because without a solid commit- ment to prevention, most patient problems will only get worse-and more expensive, says Taylor. As a result, she says, population health management will continue to be an integral part of moving the healthcare industry in a value-based direction.

"It's key to keeping costs down," she says. "If you do it right, there is less duplication in tests and less waste. You are keeping track of and coordinating a person's healthcare."

HOW SMALL PRACTICES CAN GET STARTED

Experts say the challenges facing a small practice looking to implement population health management are difficult, but not impossible, to overcome.

One of the first challenges is identifying patients with chronic conditions that might benefit from outreach efforts, and the place to start is with the EHR.

Taylor suggests seeing what tools are available within the EHR that can help identify specific groups of patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, and then develop a plan to better manage those patients. "It should be team-based care," she says, adding that much of the work is nonclinical and doesn't require a doctor's time.

"Have a nurse take a look twice a year or quarterly, to see who has been in for an appointment and how they are doing. If they haven't been in to the office in six months, you need to get them in" This level of commitment does not require advanced analytics or expensive software tools to implement, she adds.

Phadke says to start small and build gradually. For example, is the practice doing a better job of getting all diabetic patients into the office for regular exams? Are patients with high blood pressure getting regular screenings? Are all patients up to date on their vaccinations? Find out who needs what and contact patients to get them into the office, she says.

"Population health can be intimidating at first, but if you start with a smaller scope and a small set of measures, that will make it easier," Phadke says.

Another entryway to population health management is to consider becoming a patient-centered medical home (PCMH), says Jay Bhatt, DO, MPH, an internist and chief medical officer of the American Hospital Association and president of the Health Research &amp; Educational Trust.

"If you don't want to go through the whole process to becoming a PCMH, a small practice could still work toward it, allowing them to experiment with managing a population effectively. It's a great way to build competency."

WHY JOINING A LARGER GROUP MAY BE NECESSARY

While population health management can be achieved to some degree by a small practice, if payers start to require physicians to accept some downside risk in their contracts, it may require more resources than the practice can afford.

"For those with risk-based contracts, you have to have a lot more resources and there is a lot of infrastructure that goes into it," says Taylor. "You have to be able to analyze claims, there are expensive pieces of software you need and you have to pay analysts to turn the data into meaningful information."

Once patients with chronic conditions are identified, it requires staff time to act on it. "It might require hiring a [nursing assistant] or additional clerical staff, and if you are doing highrisk patient management, hopefully you are doing some health coaching. But that requires a health coach or nurse," says Taylor.

Larger organizations, like the Stanford clinics where Phadke works, have sophisticated software tools that help identify which patients need extra care as well as message the patients.

"It allows us to do a lot more with fewer personnel," she says. "But for a small practice, the upfront cost is something they would have to consider."

Nash doesn't envision a long-term future for small practices that aren't affiliated with a larger group, because he sees healthcare marching inexorably toward favoring groups and health systems that can afford high-tech tools and additional staff.

"That may not be the answer they want, but it will be incredibly hard for practices with one or two doctors to compete in the new world."

SUCCEED WHILE STAYING INDEPENDENT

There may be ways for a practice to get the tools and support it needs for population health management that don't require a complete sacrifice of independence.

Bhatt says to check with local hospitals to see if they have any affiliate programs that share resources and data with local physicians. "Getting into a clinically integrated network can be very helpful for small practices," he says. "They do not have to give up their independence, but generate economies of scale and get the resources they need."

"Shared resources are definitely a good idea" says Phadke, adding that Stanford enables sharing through its United Healthcare Alliance, a group of clinics affiliated with the university to get the tools they need to provide better care.

Joining an Accountable Care Organization may also be an option for practices. "They can share best practices and be able to share the administrative burden of doing things like claims analysis" says Taylor.

Phadke says the stakes involved in population health management are too high to ignore.

"CMS (via MIPS) added a financial reward or penalty for your Medicare patients" she says. "For private payers, population health could determine whether they will contract with you, if you are underperforming on quality measures."

Experts agree that physicians are going to need much more data on their patients to prove they are providing value, and that the demand for this data is only going to increase. It might also provide some surprises when first examined in detail.

"By measuring how you are doing on your performance and benchmarking that to your peers, it can shed light on different opportunities" says Phadke. "Most physicians think they are performing better than they are, but if they look at population health management as an opportunity to improve, it really does help patient care"

Regardless of what approach a practice takes to population health management, Nash says there really is no avoiding it.

"You can run, but you can't hide from it" he says. "We are heading toward the total accountability for the outcome of care, and with no outcomes, there will be no income for doctors, and that is a sea change"

HIGHLIGHTS

* Identify patients with chronic conditions that might benefit from outreach efforts, and the place to start is with the EHR.

* Start small and build gradually. Is the practice getting all diabetic patients into the office for regular exams? Are patients with high blood pressure getting regular screenings? Are patients up to date on their vaccinations?

"Population health is about no longer just treating the patients who walked in the door to see you today."

As both public and private payers focus more on value-based care, population health management has become more common as providers take a more proactive approach to caring for patients.

In a tweet with more than 64,000 likes and 23,000 retweets, Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., shared some extremely bad math and economics over the weekend."$21 TRILLION of Pentagon financial transactions 'could not be traced, documented, or explained.' $21T in Pentagon accounting errors. Medicare for All costs ~$32T. That means 66 percent of Medicare for All could have been funded already by the Pentagon. And thatâs before our premiums," wrote Ocasio-Cortez, citing a report in The Nation about waste at the Pentagon.Ocasio-Cortez's interpretation of the report is faulty at best and outright dishonest at worst.For one thing, the entire budget of the Pentagon from 1789 to now has been a grand total of $18 trillion, a full $3 trillion fewer than the "accounting errors" cited by Ocasio-Cortez. It's impossible for a department's waste in 17 years to exceed the budget of its entire existence.As noted by Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute Brian Reidl, the $21 trillion figure reported by the Nation "refers to transfers back-and-forth between accounts. So the same [dollar] can be counted 1000's of times." Moreover, even if the Pentagon is guilty of legendary inefficiency and mismanagement, it cannot possibly be wasting an amount trillions of dollars higher than our annual GDP.Furthermore, even if the government could clean up trillions of dollars of waste to reallocate it for socialized healthcare â a hopeless dream to begin with â it could not remotely fulfill the funding requirements for "Medicare for all."The $21 trillion figure represents unaccounted or unexplained Pentagon financial transactions over a 17-year period. The most thorough study of the economics of Bernie Sanders-style "Medicare for all," published by George Mason University's Mercatus Center, found that the plan would add $32.6 trillion to the federal budget in ten years, assuming the plan is implemented by 2022. So even this mythical $21 trillion "saved" over the course of nearly two decades could only fund about one-third of "Medicare for all" in the same amount of time, assuming that the following decade of "Medicare for all" would cost as much as the first decade. Which, by the way, is an unrealistic assumption, because healthcare spending will nearly double in the next decade according to the best projections.Furthermore, the $32.6 trillion figure is vast underestimate to begin with, one which assumed that "Medicare for all" "achieves its sponsorsâ goals of dramatically reducing payments to health providers, in addition to substantially reducing drug prices and administrative costs.âThat is, physicians and hospitals would have to be happy with a reimbursement rate 40 percent lower than today's average reimbursement rate. Given the immense costs and barriers to entry to become a physician or healthcare provider, this would cause a mass exodus of providers from the market in the long run, leaving the government forced to increase prices or let the American people face massive healthcare shortages.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, if the Pentagon really is so badly mismanaged that it burns through trillions of dollars of waste, why would we expect the same federal government to manage single payer healthcare any more efficiently? Medicare already wastes around 10 percent of its total budget, or some $60 billion of taxpayer funds, each year. An expansion of the program is unlikely to improve that number.There are certainly lessons to be gleaned from the Pentagon report. That the government needs more money and more control is not one of them.</content>

If you?d like to continue receiving Washington Examiner's Daily on Healthcare newsletter, SUBSCRIBE HERE: http://newsletters.washingtonexaminer.com/newsletter/daily-on-healthcare/March for Life releases its demands for Trump. The anti-abortion group March for Life is urging President Trump to vow that he will issue a veto letter if any spending bills are introduced that would extend access to abortion. Coming off of a midterm election that resulted in a Democratic House, March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said the organization will focus on "trying to preserve what we have.?The fact the GOP will maintain control of the Senate should help with that. Still, the group wants the president to signal to the House that he will support the priorities of March for Life and other groups that oppose abortion. That would mean issuing a veto threat if Democrats were to introduce a spending bill that would gut the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding provision that blocks federal funds from going to abortions except in the cases of rape, incest, or if a woman's pregnancy endangers her life. Other provisions that should merit such a letter, the group said, would include a plan to gut religious exemptions to medical workers who don't want to perform abortions, and blocking federal workers from using their healthcare plans to pay for abortions. They are also concerned Congress may try to undo Trump?s anti-abortion actions through the Congressional Review Act, which allows for changes to administrative actions.

March for Life also highlighted its goal of ending fetal tissue research at the press conference in Washington, D.C. Wednesday. An announcement on that issue is expected soon from the National Institutes of Health, the government's medical research agency. Tom McClusky, the vice president of government affairs at March for Life, said that he was concerned Trump and Azar, would default to the position of Francis Collins, the NIH director, who hasn't formally stated his position on the issue. Collins has been at the helm of the NIH since the Obama administration, and has for years been open about his Christian faith, speaking about it publicly and answering questions from reporters about how his faith impacts his work. Still, he has drawn the ire of anti-abortion groups, who say that medical research he supports on stem cells are not in line with their views. When asked about some of these policies in an interview with the Washington Examiner last year, Collins said some of the concerns that have been voiced haven't been scientifically accurate but that he understood the issues were emotional to many people. "Certainly, I would welcome the chance, as someone who is certainly myself probably closer to the pro-life position than most of my scientific colleagues, to explain why I think NIH's current position on stem cells is actually about as ethical as one could imagine if you just look at the details of how it is that we're conducting it," he said.Azar warns that ?disruption? in healthcare is coming. Â Health secretary, Alex Azar warned that the changes the administration had ahead would be "disruptive" to the healthcare system. "I'm a limited-government an advocate as anyone can be... but when the government has set the rules, when a system has oriented around that set of rules, it does take the government to change those rules of the road to help facilitate a competitive marketplace," Azar said. ?And that may seem big government-y, it may seem disruptive, and it will seem disruptive because you have very significant entrenched financial interests who are not at all pleased with the disruption that the president and I are planning to bring to the healthcare system."Azar had just presented a plan that the Trump administration had put forward on how to encourage free-market reforms in healthcare and remove government barriers. Outside healthcare groups have balked at proposals that the Trump administration has put forward on drug prices, including a plan to let insurers inside of Medicare have more power over which drugs they offer. "I always find it remarkable that people are so vested in the status quo that they do not stop complaining about, but they aren't willing to be part of changing it," Azar said. Analysis: Government spending on healthcare is already higher in the US than other socialist countries. One of the most popular talking points on the Left involves arguing that every other "major country on Earth" guarantees healthcare to all, which the United States does not. The talking point is an implicit suggestion that Americans are somehow more cruel than their comparatively civilized and humane counterparts on the world stage. It is accompanied by an argument for a massive increase in government spending on healthcare ? to the tune of $32 trillion. But this sidesteps a crucial reality: U.S. public spending on healthcare not only already exceeds the average of comparable countries, but also of highly socialized systems including Canada and the U.K.Wisconsin Republicans lock in Medicaid work requirements to block incoming Democratic governor. Wisconsin Republican state lawmakers have approved a Medicaid work requirement during the legislature's lame-duck session in an effort to block the incoming Democratic governor from abandoning the changes set by his GOP predecessor. The vote, which occurred early Wednesday morning, makes official a provision that will require certain Medicaid beneficiaries to work, volunteer, or take classes for 80 hours a month. If enrollees fail to follow the requirement for 48 months in a row they will be dropped from coverage. All Democrats and one Republican, Rep. Todd Novak, voted against it. The changes have the support of GOP Gov. Scott Walker, who lost re-election this year to Gov.-elect Tony Evers and will be leaving office in five weeks. The Trump administration approved the work requirement plan Oct. 31, but Evers said he planned to stop the policy from going into effect. The legislature's move will allow the work requirements to go forward.Despite investments, California's Obamacare enrollment lags slightly. Enrollment in California's Obamacare exchange is falling slightly behind compared with last year, even though state officials have heavily supported the healthcare law. As of Nov. 30, enrollment was 1,290,500, a drop of just under 1 percent down from the 1,302,000 customers who signed up for plans around the same time last year. Democrats in Congress have warned that sign-ups would fall behind in the Obamacare exchange that most of the rest of the country uses, called healthcare.gov. That site is operated by the federal government, and Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to sabotage the healthcare law because it has slashed the budget for organizations that help people enroll, cut ads, and reduced the sign-up period from three months to six weeks. And enrollment there has lagged by a larger percentage than in California, by about 11 percent. But California has not pursued the same actions as the Trump administration. It is spending $110 million on advertising and outreach, and has kept the sign-up deadline to three months. It also has banned the sale of short-term plans. How California officials explain the slight shortfall. California officials noted in a release that they delayed state marketing of open enrollment until after Election Day, meaning that two weeks of open enrollment had kicked off before that point. James Scullary, a Covered California spokesman, stressed that enrollment should be compared with 2016 figures instead, because there was an election that year as well and marketing operated similarly. When compared to those numbers, the pace of enrollment for new customers is slightly ahead. In 2016, 80,000 new customers picked plans, compared with 90,500 this year. The office did not provide total enrollment for 2016 in time for deadline, and the numbers were not recorded in the press release archives. A release from Covered California theorized that awareness about the law may be a factor for the slowdown, because last year the media extensively covered the debate over "repeal and replace" in Congress. That year, however, overall enrollment in the California exchange after the final deadline fell by roughly 2.3 percent.Lower exchange enrollment doesn?t necessarily mean a boost in the uninsured. It's possible in each of these cases that people are choosing to purchase health insurance directly through an insurer instead of on the healthcare.gov website, or that former customers are getting coverage through a job instead. Nearly two-thirds of Obamacare plans have narrow networks: study. An analysis by the healthcare firm Avalere Health found that 72 percent of plans sold are health maintenance organizations and exclusive provider organizations, a similar percentage as the ones sold for 2018. The rest are preferred provider organizations and point of service organizations, which have a broader number of providers they cover. Using narrower networks is one way that insurers keep costs at bay. ?Provider networks are getting narrower, which means it is more important than ever that patients understand what kind of plans they are buying,? Chris Sloan, director at Avalere, said in a statement. ?Unknowingly enrolling in a narrow network plan could lead to patients being unable to see their preferred doctor or go to their most convenient hospital.? Critical spending deal hinges on Trump, Schumer. House and Senate lawmakers Tuesday were no closer to finding a year-end spending deal that will ultimately depend on negotiations between President Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. who have yet to hold talks. Congress this week is poised to pass a two-week extension of government funding for a small group of bills that cover about a quarter of the federal budget. Â The extra time, lawmakers hope, will provide enough opportunity for Democrats to work out a deal with Trump on how much money to include for the construction of a southern border wall. Prior to the two-week extension deal, government funding had been set to expire Dec. 7. Now lawmakers have until December 21. The spending stalemate between Democrats and Republicans has not ended yet. Hoyer: 'We don't have our own tea party now' with new progressive Democrats. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., argued Tuesday that House Democrats do not have their own version of the Tea Party rumbling through the left-wing factions of the party after the November election. The incoming House majority leader pointed to the House Freedom Caucus, a group of roughly three dozen conservatives, and their unwillingness in the past to negotiate with GOP leaders, most notably former Speaker John Boehner. He said that there is nothing like that facing the House Democrats and that they are largely united. "We don't have our own tea party now. You'll see that," Hoyer told the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit. "You'll see that nobody in our caucus now -- and I don't think there's going to be any significant number now and I don't think there's going to be any significant number tomorrow, January being tomorrow, where you're going to have people say 'either my way or no way.'" "We'll see if we have anybody like that," Hoyer added, arguing that the party has consensus on many issues, including healthcare and infrastructure.AgileHealthInsurance is selling short-term health plans that extend for three years. The company made the announcement Tuesday, saying that customers could enroll in the plans and didn?t need to re-apply. The Trump administration extended the plans for this duration, undoing a rule that was put in place toward the end of former President Barack Obama?s term. States such as Alabama, Florida, and Kentucky have already implemented the provision. These types of plans do not tend to cover medical care for people with pre-existing conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, but the company is providing the option of adding a ?pre-existing conditions waiver.? This means that any medical conditions discovered after the start of the initial policy will be covered for the rest of the terms, the company said in a statement. CVS offers locked-in drug costs amid new federal pressure over Aetna deal. CVS Health will begin to provide clients a locked-in, average cost per covered drug and pay for any additional inflation in treatment expenses, a move that comes as middlemen pharmacy benefit managers face increasing pressure from the government. CVS Health's new pricing model will enable clients, which often are corporations and other large business entities, "to clearly see the net cost of their pharmacy benefit and select their PBM provider based on that criteria," President Derica Rice said in a statement. "We see a real opportunity to offer clients a simpler economic model." The company will account for inflation in drug costs, as well as the possible shift to cheaper generics and the amount of expected rebates, in providing its clients a guaranteed average cost per prescription.American kids are 'political chips' in gun control battle, Aetna CEO says. America's partisan standoff over gun regulation has made pawns of the nation's youth, Mark Bertolini, the former CEO of insurer Aetna, said Tuesday. "Let's just make these changes and make them now," Bertolini said at a Washington, D.C., conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal. "We should never feel like our children are political chips in a battle over legislation.? Aetna donated $200,000 to a firearm reform rally and banned political donations to individuals with a favorable rating from the National Rifle Association after two of its employees were killed during a shooting in a gay nightclub in Orlando in 2016. Bertolini said he called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky after the Pulse shooting to urge him to advance firearm legislation. "It hasn't worked," he said. "We're still in this place."RUNDOWNÂ Modern Healthcare Hospitals sue over site-neutral payment policyThe Hill Bipartisan senators introduce new drug pricing billAsbury Park Press Medicare for all?

    <content type="text">(Press Releases)                                               
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 -- The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued the following news release: 
 
Overall national health spending grew at a rate of 3.9 percent in 2017, almost 1.0 percentage point slower than growth in 2016, according to a study conducted by the Office of the Actuary at the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and published online today ahead of print by Health Affairs. Medicare spending grew at about the same rate in 2017 as in 2016, while Medicaid spending grew at a slower rate in 2017 than in 2016. 
 
According to the report, overall healthcare spending growth slowed in 2017 for the three largest goods and service categories - hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs. Details from the slower spending growth in these three largest goods and service categories are: 
 
* Hospital spending (33 percent of total healthcare spending) decelerated in 2017, growing 4.6 percent to $1.1 trillion compared to 5.6 percent growth in 2016. The slower growth for 2017 reflected slower growth in the use and intensity of services, as growth in outpatient visits slowed while growth in inpatient days increased at about the same rate in both 2016 and 2017. 
 
* Physician and clinical services spending (20 percent of total healthcare spending) increased 4.2 percent to $694.3 billion in 2017. This increase followed more rapid growth of 5.6 percent in 2016 and 6.0 percent in 2015. Less growth in total spending for physician and clinical services in 2017 was a result of a deceleration in growth in the use and intensity of physician and clinical services. 
 
* Retail prescription drug spending (10 percent of total healthcare spending) slowed in 2017, increasing 0.4 percent to $333.4 billion. This slower rate of growth followed 2.3 percent growth in 2016, which was much slower than in 2014, when spending grew 12.4 percent, and in 2015, when spending grew 8.9 percent. These higher rates of growth in 2014 and 2015 were primarily the result of the introduction of new, innovative medicines and faster growth in prices for existing brand-name drugs. Retail prescription drug spending growth slowed in 2017 primarily due to slower growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed, a continued shift to lower-cost generic drugs, slower growth in the volume of some high-cost drugs, declines in generic drug prices, and lower price increases for existing brand-name drugs. 
 
The 3.9 percent growth in healthcare spending was slightly slower than growth in the overall economy (4.2 percent) in 2017. As a result, the healthcare spending share of the economy (17.9 percent) was similar to the share in 2016 (18.0 percent). Growth in overall healthcare spending slowed for the second consecutive year, following elevated rates of growth in 2014 and 2015 that were affected by expanded Medicaid and private health insurance coverage and increased spending for prescription drugs, particularly for drugs used to treat hepatitis C. 
 
Additional highlights from the report regarding the source of funds include: 
 
Private health insurance spending (34 percent of total healthcare spending) increased 4.2 percent to $1.2 trillion in 2017, which was slower than the 6.2 percent growth in 2016. The deceleration was influenced by slower growth in medical benefits and a decline in fees and taxes resulting from the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016, which suspended collection of the health insurance provider fee in 2017. 
 
Medicare spending (20 percent of total healthcare spending) grew 4.2 percent to $705.9 billion in 2017, which was about the same rate as in 2016 when spending grew 4.3 percent. In 2017, slower growth in fee-for-service Medicare (Medicare FFS) spending (1.4 percent in 2017 compared to 2.6 percent in 2016) offset faster growth in spending for Medicare private health plans (10.0 percent in 2017 compared to 8.1 percent in 2016). The trends in Medicare FFS and Medicare private health plan spending are attributed in part to an increasing share of all Medicare beneficiaries enrolling in Medicare Advantage. 
 
Medicaid spending (17 percent of total healthcare spending) growth slowed in 2017, increasing 2.9 percent to $581.9 billion following growth of 4.2 percent in 2016. The slower growth in total Medicaid expenditures in 2017 was influenced by a deceleration in enrollment growth and a reduction in the net cost of Medicaid health insurance resulting from an increase in recoveries from Medicaid managed care plans for favorable prior period experience. State and local Medicaid expenditures grew 6.4 percent, while federal Medicaid expenditures increased 0.8 percent in 2017. In 2017, states were required to fund 5 percent of the costs of the Medicaid expansion population, while in prior years these costs were funded entirely by the federal government. 
 
Out-of-pocket spending (10 percent of total healthcare spending) includes direct consumer payments such as copayments, deductibles, and spending not covered by insurance. Out-of-pocket spending grew 2.6 percent to $365.5 billion in 2017, which was slower than the 4.4 percent growth in 2016. 
 
Sponsors of Healthcare. In 2017, the federal government's spending on healthcare slowed, increasing 3.2 percent after 4.9 percent growth in 2016. The deceleration was largely associated with slower federal Medicaid spending due to lower Medicaid enrollment growth, a reduction in the federal government's share of funding for newly eligible Medicaid enrollees, and a decline in the net cost of insurance for Medicare and Medicaid enrollees in private plans in 2017. Growth in household spending on healthcare also slowed in 2017, increasing 3.8 percent following growth of 4.8 percent in 2016. The slowdown was mainly driven by slower growth in out-of-pocket spending. 
 
The National Health Expenditure estimates have been revised to reflect the most recent and up-to-date source data that is available (and may not have been available for last year's vintage of the National Health Expenditure Accounts).

* * *

- Prescription drug assistance program for seniors will continue The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) announced it is granting a temporary extension of Wisconsin's SeniorCare waiver, which is set to expire at the end of 2018. The temporary extension allows the program to continue as CMS finalizes its review of the application for a long-term extension.

In April of 2018, under the direction of Governor Scott Walker, the Department of Health Services (DHS) submitted an application requesting an extension of its Section 1115 Research and Demonstration Project waiver, known as the SeniorCare Prescription Drug Assistance Program. The current three-year waiver expires December 31, 2018, and DHS is now requesting a ten-year extension so the state may continue to operate the program through December 31, 2028.

SeniorCare is an income-based prescription drug assistance program for Wisconsin residents who are 65 years of age or older. The only state-run program in the nation, SeniorCare works in coordination with Medicare Part D, allowing seniors to choose the drug coverage that is right for them and ensuring that coverage is comprehensive and cost-effective. Currently, about 50,000 Wisconsin seniors depend on SeniorCare to help with the cost of prescription drugs.

AbbVie announced Friday (Nov. 30) that it has reached an agreement to delay the launch of Pfizer's biosimilar referencing the blockbuster arthritis drug Humira. The latest settlement is AbbVie's seventh with different companies to delay biosimilars of Humira, which is the best-selling prescription drug in the world. Pfizer will be allowed to launch on Nov. 20, 2023 if it obtains FDA approval. Amgen can release its biosimilar in January of that same year, Samsung Bioepis in June 2023, Mylan in July 2023, and Fresenius Kabi and Sandoz in September 2023.

Pfizer declined to comment on if the company has applied for FDA approval, or when it would plan to submit an application. FDA has approved three Humira biosimilars so far, from Sandoz, Amgen and Boehringer Ingelheim. Boehringer Ingelheim is suing AbbVie for allegedly creating a wrongful patent thicket around Humira.

AbbVie has faced criticism from the advocacy group Patients For Affordable Drugs and from lawmakers that the settlements are a pay-for-delay tactic to keep lower-cost biosimilar versions of its drugs off the market.

Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA), the incoming Finance Committee chairman, said in a floor speech Thursday that passing legislation prohibiting pay-for-delay arrangements is on his list of drug pricing priorities.

AbbVie has denied using "pay for delay" arrangements.

"AbbVie's settlements with Amgen and Samsung Bioepis are in no way pay-for-delay arrangements. AbbVie is not paying Amgen or Samsung Bioepis, and in fact both Amgen and Samsung Bioepis will be paying royalties to AbbVie once their adalimumab biosimilar products launch in the [United States]," the company said in a statement earlier this year. -- Rachel Cohrs (rcohrs@iwpnews.com)</content>

IHA Presents to Hospital Transformation Committee 
IHA President &amp; CEO A.J. Wilhelmi and Senior Vice President Patrick Gallagher on Wednesday gave an extensive presentation on preliminary policy recommendations for the Medicaid Hospital Transformation Program to the legislative Hospital Transformation Review Committee, which met in Chicago and Springfield. 
 
To develop preliminary recommendations for the allocation of the $263 million in hospital transformation funding established in the assessment redesign legislation, IHA created an 18-member Hospital Transformation Task Force â representing all segments of Illinois hospitals and geographic areas across the state. The IHA Task Force met five times from June to October and developed principles and policy recommendations to serve as a framework for allocating the transformation funding to support hospitals that want to transform their delivery models to meet the healthcare needs of their communities in a financially sustainable manner. The IHA Board of Trustees reviewed and revised the preliminary recommendations in November. 
 
Included in the preliminary recommendations are key transformation principles: 
  Reform is about meeting needs of the community across the continuum of care;  Transformation activities should be measured with indicators such as improving access to care in short term and improving health status/quality of life in the long term;  Delivery system reform is about the entire system, not just hospitals, and requires carefully thought through partnerships;  Reform outcomes must be sustainable with rational payment systems;  Accountability must be achieved before funds are delivered; and  Adequate time is needed for proper planning.   
Wilhelmi and Gallagher also described and explained the preliminary recommendations that focus on four key issues: Distribution of Funding, Priority Participation Criteria, Required Elements for Transformation Proposals, and Financing Parameters. 
 
They noted that some hospitals â due to lack of resources â may need consulting assistance to examine options and prepare proposals and suggested that the State should consider providing consulting services for these hospitals. Wilhelmi also raised the issue of ongoing challenges with Medicaid managed care â including denials, billing and payment delays â that impact the financial viability of some hospitals and create additional challenges to transformation. Wilhelmi also expressed appreciation to Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) Director Patti Bellock and her staff for their efforts to try to address these MCO challenges. 
 
Earlier this week, IHA sent members a detailed overview of the preliminary policy recommendations and will be seeking feedback from members in the coming weeks. The IHA Board will consider that feedback at its meeting in late January, with IHA presenting its final recommendations to the Hospital Transformation Review Committee and HFS in February. 
 
The Review Committee also heard presentations Wednesday from the Association of Safety Net Community Hospitals and SEIU Healthcare. The safety net group proposes that priority funding in the Transformation Program go to Safety Net Hospitals (as defined in state statute), psychiatric hospitals above 50 percent MIUR, Critical Access Hospitals and Childrenâs Hospitals and that Safety Net Hospitals get credit for prior transformation initiatives. SEIU proposes that the primary purpose of the program should be to reduce health disparities and expand access to care. SEIU proposes to direct program funding to DSH, Safety Net and Critical Access Hospitals, and says transformation projects should expand services and support the workforce and address health inequities. 
 
The Hospital Transformation Review Committee will next meet in January (date to be scheduled). 
  
IHA Cook County Reception Dec. 12 
IHA is hosting a reception for hospital leaders and the Cook County Board of Commissioners on Wed., Dec. 12 from 4-6 p.m. at 312 Chicago. Click here for more information and to RSVP. 
  
State, National Marketplace Open Enrollment Lagging 
The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services released week five data (Nov. 25 â Dec. 1) for the health insurance marketplace open enrollment. During week five, more than 773,000 consumers renewed or purchased health insurance via Healthcare.gov . That figure is lower than week five figures from 2017 (Nov. 26 â Dec. 2), which showed more than 823,000 consumers selecting or renewing coverage. 
 
From Nov. 1 â Dec. 1, nearly 3.2 million consumers selected a new plan or renewed their coverage. That figure is lower than 2017 open enrollment figures for that same timeframe (Nov. 1-Dec. 2), which showed 3.6 million consumers selecting or renewing coverage. 
 
Cumulative 2018 enrollment figures (Nov. 1 â Dec. 1) for Illinois show more than 100,000 Illinoisans purchasing or renewing their coverage via the health insurance marketplace. When compared to cumulative data from 2017 for that same timeframe, Illinoisâ health insurance marketplace enrollment is down about 27,000. 
 
Dec. 15 is the last day of open enrollment on the health insurance marketplace. Make sure to visit www.GetCovered.Illinois.gov . 
  
HHS Announces Senior Advisor for Drug Pricing Reform 
Today, the Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that John OâBrien will serve as Senior Advisor to the Secretary for Drug Pricing Reform. Previously, OâBrien had served as Advisor to the Secretary for health reform and drug pricing, as well as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health Policy within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. 
 
Prior to his time at HHS, OâBrien, a pharmacist, was Vice President of Public Policy for CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. He has also worked at the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the Notre Dame of Maryland University College of Pharmacy, and various pharmacy and pharmaceutical organizations. 
 
An HHS blog post authored by OâBrien discusses his thoughts on the International Pricing Index (IPI) demonstration project. In support of the project, OâBrien said, âSimply put: The IPI demo doesnât just seek to end foreign free-riding, it introduces competition and negotiation to Medicare Part B drugs. And it provides drug companies with a valid reason to walk away from the negotiating table when other countries demand low prices subsidized by Americaâs seniors. The socialist systems to whom drug companies are giving better deals simply do not have monopoly power when compared to the importance of participating in the Medicare program.â 
  
Briefly Noted 
Today, the U.S. Senate and House passed a continuing resolution to fund the government until Dec. 21. The stop-gap measure awaiting President Trumpâs approval would avert a Dec. 7 partial shutdown and postpone a funding battle over a U.S.-Mexico border wall.</content>

TOP-STORY 

Published 56 minutes ago Published 56 minutes ago The Senior Cohort of the Health and Human Values Honors College minor hosted their first poster presentation at the Slonaker House living room on Wednesday, Dec. 5. 

The Health and Human Values Honors College minor is designed to provide a unique and interdisciplinary perspective that challenges scientific and western thinking. Each student conducted a semester-long thesis or proposal to seek understanding and intervention on social issues with respect to health and healthcare. 

The topics covered included traditional Chinese medicine, current healthcare coverage policies, mental health in aging populations, community para medicine and health on the UA campus.

Gabriella Liace, a molecular and cellular biology major with a minor in physiology, biochemistry and honor human values, dedicated her time to analyzing how intravenous drug users are being limited in harm reduction methods because of who they are and the stigma related to their disease. RELATED: Her research question investigated if these intravenous drug users living with HIV/AIDS benefit from the reduction of stigma and increase of structural competency micro- and macro-levels, and, if so, how. 

âIn the United States we are not legally able to fund needle-exchange programs, meaning we cannot give clean needles to this community,â Liace said. âFor their syringe service program, they do health education brochures, alcohol wipes and cotton balls. That's kind of the limits of these programs, and that is not what these people need. They need harm reduction efforts so that this is not a perceptual problem.â 

She found that not only were these people being limited in treatment, but their total treatment cost is much higher, which has made the development of prevention efforts and good needle-exchange programs much harder. 

On the micro-level, some scientists have blamed prostitution and drugs for the heinous disease, which generates negative attention in the general public opinion, Liace said, which then affects the macro-level structural competencies. 

On the macro-level, those scientists are the people in charge of generating funding and forming research committees, she added. They end up being detrimental to the community by refusing to fund programs that will help the HIV/AIDS community. Through her research, she found that an investment of $64 million would result in an estimated $193 million in savings by preventing 500 new HIV infections.

Liaceâs thesis aimed to inform people about the huge gap in funding and programs for intravenous drug users, in addition to explaining how an expansion of resources and a needle-exchange program would change the Pima County community. RELATED: CJ Ryan, another student who presented at this event, committed her semester to her thesis "Adverse Birth Outcomes as a Symptom of Multifaceted Socioeconomic and Health Burdens in Populations of Homeless Women." 

She proposed a model that addresses how health outcomes for pregnant women experiencing homelessness can be improved. Poor conditions that are connected to socio-economic burdens do contribute to poor health and subsequent birth outcomes among this population. 

Ryan found that unique health burdens, such as lack of education, shelter, healthcare, nutrition and safety, could be harmful to fetus development. Therefore, the gestational period is crucial.

âAny intervention that seeks to remedy adverse birth outcomes in the homeless population should alleviate socio-economic burdens that contribute to cycles of poverty and health disparities in order to be effective,â Ryan said.

Her research demonstrated that the shelter model is the most highly effective in improving the health of homeless individuals. 

Ryan said she is interested in reducing adverse birth outcomes, because although the U.S. spends more on healthcare than any other nation, it also has one of the worse birth outcomes of any developed nation. Therefore, she said she found this issue to be particularly important to her because she wants to be an OB/GYN.

    <content type="text">/Newswire/ -- According to data compiled by Mordor Intelligence, the global retail industry was valued at USD 23.46 Trillion in 2018 and is expected to reach USD 31.88 Trillion by 2023. Additionally, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.3% during the forecast period. The market is also being driven by e-commerce sales as more consumers are looking to use the internet to do their shopping online. The e-commerce sector alone has tripled in size over the past three years, driven by a growing number of mobile devices and emerging payment platforms. The market will continue to grow as long as there is a demand from consumers for products sold within retail locations. According to Best Buy's recent financial results, the Company stated that it generated a significant comparable sales growth, primarily through tech devices such as phones, games, appliances, smart homes and wearables. Nxt-ID, Inc. (NASD: NXTD), Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE: BBY), Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASD: WBA) There are many tech-based products sold by retailers, but specifically, wearables devices are highly popular. Wearable devices are growing in adoption due to their real time data monitoring and ability to track fitness, which is consequently driving the wearable medical device segment. According to research by Markets and Markets, the wearable medical device market is projected to reach USD 14.41 Billion by 2022, while growing at a CAGR of 18.3%. The market is expanding due to the increasing number of smartphones and number of healthcare-based smartphone apps compatible with wearable devices. "Health care and health-focused applications in general will be a major driver for the next phase of growth in wearables," says Tractica Research Director Aditya Kaul in the Company's 2017 Wearable Device Market Forecasts report. "Wearable device companies that pivot beyond fitness and activity tracking, toward preventing and managing chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart problems will succeed in the long run." Nxt-ID, Inc. (NASD: NXTD) yesterday announced, "the commercial launch of Notifi911, a Personal Emergency Response (PERS) device, to be sold direct to consumers through big box retail stores and other sales channels. Notifi911, LogicMark's newest Mobile Emergency Response pendant, will connect users to 911 at the touch of a button on the wearable pendant allowing them to speak directly to a 911 operator anytime and anywhere there is cellular service.

'The retail launch of Notifi911 represents a significant expansion of our product offerings and distribution channels, which will allow us to offer security and safety products to entirely new markets and customers,' said Kevin O'Connor, President of Logicmark. 'Partnering with the nation's leading retailers offers an important new channel for our PERS products and will provide us with strong consumer distribution in the fast growing global PERS retail market.'

Notifi911 will be available at Best Buy, BestBuy.com and other national retailers. It is currently undergoing the product onboarding process through Best Buy and will be available to purchase in the coming months. The launch of Notifi911, a self-contained unit that does not require a base station, landline or cellular plan, follows extensive in-store trials. There are no monthly charges, no monitoring fees, and no contract to use the device, which offers a distinct value proposition over other devices currently on the market. The Notifi911 pendant is fully rechargeable with a standby time of 3 months when fully charged. The robust design of the Notifi911 allows the pendant to get wet so it can be carried and used during outdoor activities and during heavy rain. LogicMark offers a one-year limited warranty on Notifi911.

'Our PERS device provides users with the comfort of knowing that with the touch of a button they can immediately reach emergency operators,' said Stanley Washington, Chief revenue officer and president healthcare for NXT-ID, Inc. 'We have seen strong demand from consumers who want that level of security and safety without a monthly fee. Launching our retail distribution strategy is a major step in making our devices available to a wider marketplace.'

LogicMark is currently a major provider of PERS to the Veterans Administration. The Company's non-monitored product offering has disrupted the market for PERS by providing its end-users a product at less than 10 percent of the cost to customers over lifetime use of monitored devices offered by its competitors. LogicMark operates in the $6.3 billion global PERS market, which is projected to grow to $8.4 billion in 2020 (Source: IndustryARC Market Research). There are three major trends driving the market growth in PERS:

Greater Desire for Connectivity and Independence: There is an increased desire for safety devices by people over 60 years of age who now represent the fastest growing demographic in social media, outdoor activities and vacation travel. One third of Americans aged 65+ fall at least once per year resulting in more than 2 million injuries annually (Source: Home &amp; Community Preferences of the 45+ Population, AARP). Increase in Violent Crimes: The estimated number of violent crimes increased for the second straight year in the U.S. (4.1 percent). In 2017 there were an estimated 1,248,185 violent crimes and an estimated 7,919,035 property crimes. Rape and aggravated assault increased 6.3 percent and 4.6 percent. 88 percent of on campus college crimes are sexual assault and 61 percent are Aggravated Assault (Source: Statista). Raising Cost of Workplace Injuries: More than 4.1 million people in the U.S. suffer a workplace injury resulting in more than 1.1 million days of work lost by employees every year. Additionally, the number of assaults against real estate agents, hospitality staff and other business professionals is on the rise. Industries with the highest rate of injury include construction, fishermen, roofers, transportation workers and agricultural workers (Source: United States Department of Labor/ OSHA). 

For seniors, falls result in more than 2 million injuries treated in emergency departments, including over 550,000 hospitalizations and more than 18,000 deaths per year. Falls are the leading cause of fatal injury and the most common cause of nonfatal trauma-related hospital admissions among older adults. (Source: NCOA). The financial toll for older adult falls is expected to increase as the population ages and may reach $54.9 billion by 2020.

Other market opportunities for the Notifi911 retail offering include:

Hospitality, hotel and resort industry employees College students and teachers Joggers, hikers, bikers and climbers Fishermen and hunters Real estate agents and bank tellers Oil workers and construction Extreme athletes and surfers Singles living alone 

LogicMark's has a long history of providing PERS devices to those aging in place and with medical conditions the ability to call 911 or to alert family and friends to an emergency with the simple touch of a button. The Company is a leading provider of medical alert systems that offer this emergency service without a monthly fee or contract. LogicMark offers both monitored and non-monitored PERS devices. Prior to this retail launch of Notifi911, the Company's devices were primarily sold through dealers and medical devices distributors as well as through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE: BBY) recently announced its results for the third quarter ended November 3nd, 2018, as compared to the third quarter ended October 28th, 2017. Domestic revenue of USD 8.76 Billion increased 3.1% versus last year, driven by comparable sales growth of 4.3%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 287 Best Buy Mobile and 19 large-format store closures over the past year. The comparable sales growth of 4.3% included an approximate 70-basis point negative impact from a calendar shift resulting from the extra week in FY18. From a merchandising perspective, the Company generated comparable sales growth across multiple categories, with the largest drivers being mobile phones, gaming, appliances, wearables, headphones and smart home. These positive drivers were partially offset by a decline in the tablet category. "Our team just delivered another strong quarter with 4.3% comparable sales growth and better-than-expected earnings growth," said Hubert Joly, Best Buy chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Similar to the first half of the year, our topline performance was helped by a favorable environment and driven by how customers are responding to the unique and elevated experience we are building. We have continued to make significant progress against our Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue strategy, including expanding our In-Home Advisor program, growing our Total Tech Support members and completing the acquisition of GreatCall, a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers. We are energized by our continued momentum and overall performance and see significant value-generation opportunity ahead of us by successfully enriching lives with technology and providing services and solutions that solve real customer needs."

    <content type="text">Sharp-eyed critics noticed that Merckâs commitment to hold price increases on its entire portfolio to the rate of inflation would allow it to jack up prices on its most profitable formulations and balance them with price cuts on its duds.
Sure enough, Merckâs new price increases will apply to Keytruda (up 1.5%) and its popular vaccines Gardasil (for human papillomavirus), MMRII (for measles, mumps and rubella) and Pneumovax (for pneumonia).
Those vaccines, which were Merckâs third-, fifth- and ninth-best-selling drugs in 2017, are going up by 6% each, a spokeswoman told me.

    <content type="text">The Trump administration has proposed several reforms to drive down prescription drug prices.

One measure would force pharmaceutical companies to mention the sticker prices of their medicines in television advertisements. The new mandate covers all prescriptions drugs reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid that cost more than $35 a month. The administration hopes this change will empower patients to choose more affordable drugs and embarrass companies into reducing their prices. But the rule won't achieve those goals.

Instead, it would mislead customers into thinking drug prices are higher than they actually are. It could deter patients from asking doctors about medicines that would improve or save their lives.

The rule would require advertisements to announce drugs' "wholesale acquisition cost." That's the sticker price manufacturers set when they introduce products to market.

Pharmaceutical companies don't actually receive this amount; it's merely the starting point for pricing negotiations with health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and other middlemen in the supply chain. These negotiations result in substantial discounts. On average, manufacturers rebate onethird of a drug's sticker price back to payers. Often, discounts can cut 60 percent or more off the sticker price. Last year alone, manufacturers offered more than $150 billion in discounts and rebates.

Manufacturer discounts wouldn't be reflected in ads. So the price patients see on their screens would be substantially higher than the true, discounted price. Even that discounted price doesn't represent what people pay at the pharmacy counter. Patients' out-of-pocket spending depends on their insurance plans, which detail their co-pays, co-insurance, deductibles, and so on. It's entirely possible that a patient could pay just a few dollars for a drug with a sticker price of hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars.

Forcing drug companies to announce unrepresentative list prices could actively harm patients' health. Beyond making patients anxious, sticker shock could prevent people from taking necessary medications.

As prices go up, patients are less likely to adhere to their prescriptions. Doubling patient copays reduces adherence by as much as 45 percent. If patients mistakenly believe they're going to spend a small fortune, they may never inquire about medicines that could keep them healthy. Patients ought to be better informed about drug costs. But there's a better way to offer that transparency.

Drug manufacturers have proposed directing TV viewers to websites that provide detailed pricing breakdowns about drugs. Online, manufacturers have the space to provide essential details and more accurate price estimations that can't be squished into 30-second commercials.

The Trump administration's new advertising proposal is well-intentioned --but it's likely to scare people away from needed medications. Officials would be wise to shelve the rule.

    <content type="text">Congress wonât be able to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) after the midterm elections handed Democrats control of the House of Representatives â but that doesnât mean lawmakers are done tinkering with the 2010 health care overhaul law. 
 
Democrats ran and won on health care and the new House majority is expected to make strengthening the ACAÂ  a top priority next year. For some lawmakers, this means passing measures to further stabilize the marketplace, where over 10 million consumers purchase private insurance.Â For others, this involves investigating federal sabotage Â efforts. Lawmakers are also feeling pressure to do something about protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which was a central campaign issue, particularly following the Trump administrationâs announcement that it would no longer defend the ACA in court . 
 
Meanwhile, Democrats are going to continue to debateÂ  Medicare buy-in andÂ  Medicare for All Â legislation, jump-starting talks about where the party goes from here. Senators also want to tackle drug prices . 
 
But thereâs only so much political capital Democrats can spend on shoring up the ACA marketplace where Â people access health care when they canât get employer-based plans: ThinkProgress reached out to six experts familiar with how policy affects people, to see what they think Congress should prioritize . Wh ile everyone was concerned about the Texas lawsuit trying to end the ACA, most agreed that the best strategy for lawmakers when it comes to defending consumer protections is to simply not repeal the law. Also, although Trump stopped paying for subsidies in 2017 thatÂ  offset costs for insurers covering low-income people, none of the experts prioritized restoring those subsidies unless the administration outlaws the workaround Â that effectively gets companies paid. No one emphasized restoring the federal individual mandate either. Â  
 
Hereâs the immediate action experts recommend: 
 Nevada marketplace director: Kill the subsidy cap  
âThe emphasis and energy from federal lawmakers should absolutely be on stabilizing the individual market and finding more opportunities to offer affordable, qualified health plans [with] comprehensive benefits,â saidÂ Nevada Exchange Executive DirectorÂ HeatherÂ Korbulic. 
 
ForÂ Korbulic, that means subsidizing health plans for people who earn over 400 percent of the federal poverty level, orÂ $100,400 for a family of four. Currently, only people who earn between 100 and 400 percent of FPL qualify for ACA premium tax credits. 
 
âThose individuals are the ones who are being priced out of the market and those are the individuals that are seeing short-term limited duration plans as a more affordable option â potentially not understanding the whole ramifications ofÂ  purchasing such a subpar plan,âÂ Korbulic told ThinkProgress. âI worry about those people and think we should focus initiatives on them.â 
 
Itâs worth noting, legislation to kill the 400 percent cap already exists in the Senate .

(Photo by Toya Sarno Jordan/)   
Korbulic would also like lawmakers to fix the âfamily glitch,â a rule that bases premium subsidies on whether an employer-based health plan is available and affordable for only the employee and not the entire family. A Senate billÂ  tries to fix the glitch Â but, like the kill-the-cap bill, hasnât moved forward. 
 
Finally, if federal officials are already asking the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) questions, Korbulic would like to know where dollars from user fees Â that federally-facilitated marketplaces pay are going. âEspecially when you are cutting outreach and advertising so significantly, what is happening?â she said. 
 Coloradoâs chief insurer regulator: Do something for folks who donât get subsidies  
Colorado officials are doing all they can to protect patients from certain federal health policies â namely, the administrationâs expansion of skimpy health plans. The state is already regulating short-term health plans Â and is even trying to make them less skimpy, requiring these plans to cover essential health benefits. The goal is to make sure patients donât accidentally buy plans they assume will cover, for example, maternity care, but donât. (The ACA covers maternity care, butÂ  no short-term plan does .) 
 
âIf it is the case, as it appears to be right now, that Congress isnât going to move anything, at least substantively, through both chambers and have the president sign anything that really helps with the consumer confusion pieceâ¦ we are going to do what we can in the state of Colorado and lots of other states will do that too,â saidÂ interim Insurance CommissionerÂ Michael Conway. 
 
That said, states canât do it all alone. Like Korbulic, Conway is hoping federal lawmakers do something to help middle-income folks afford quality insurance. That could be federalÂ  reinsurance , or insurance for insurers. Nevada state lawmakers tried to get a state reinsurance program but the GOP-controlled senate blocked it. 
 
âBut if we are going to do anything sustainable for folks â if we are going to provide real relief for people in the health care markets â we have to address costs, whether thatâs pharmaceutical costs or hospital costs or doctors costs,â Conway told ThinkProgress. âWe have to figure out a way to reduce the amount of money that is going into the health care system.â 
  
    
     Hereâs what you need to know about the lawsuit trying to end Obamacare  
Who's defending the ACA if the Trump admin refuses to do so? What parts of the law are in trouble? What about your health care? 
 
 
   New Jersey governor: open enrollment  
Unlike Colorado, New Jersey successfully implemented a reinsurance program, which brought down premiums , and also has a state mandate requiring people to have insurance. State officials have done all they can to counteract the administrationâs efforts to undermine the ACA and, yet, enrollment is still down compared to last year. 
 
Gov. Phil Murphy (D) is optimistic that a lot more people will sign up during the final days of enrollment, and previous periods suggest heâs right, as thereâs usually a last-minute surge. But states can only do so much. 
 
âWeâve done everything we can do, but I donât think we can underestimate the damage thatâs been done by the Trump administration and GOP-controlled Congress,âÂ Murphy told ThinkProgress by phone. 
 
So, heâs calling on lawmakers to, at the very least, take modest action. 
 
âIâll give you a simple one â¦ Iâd hope that we could get the enrollment period back to the amount of time that it used to be and fund the public service announcements that need to go hand-in-hand with that,â said Murphy. ( In 2017 , the administration shorted enrollment by more than half and slashed advertisement and outreach.) 
 
Having lawmakers intervene in the Texas lawsuit, on the other hand, might be harder. So while the governor wants Congress to âweigh in heavilyâ on the lawsuit, he understands GOP lawmakers might impede. (The administration, itself,Â  isnât defending the law.)

   Mom who fought against Obamacare repeal: consumer protections  
Co-founder of Little Lobbyists Elena Hung was the only expert to suggest that Congress immediately prioritize action against the Texas lawsuit. The ACA has meant the difference between life or death for her family, as her daughter has chronic lung and kidney disease; this is why her organization wasÂ  formed â to help defeat the GOP health bill. 
 
âFamilies like mine are extremely concerned about the TX lawsuit and absolutely want congressional intervention,â Hung told ThinkProgress by email. 
 
âWithout the preexisting condition protections in the ACA, health care for medically complex children â and millions of other Americans â is at risk. Members of Congress â both Ds and Rs â should make good on their campaign rhetoric and do whatever they can to ensure the ACAâs protections for preexisting conditions continue uninterrupted.â 
 
The ACA isnât perfect, she admitted. The long term solution should be âensuring universal, quality, affordable health care for all â including long term supports and services and home and community-based care.â 
 Obama-era official turned advocate: Hold HHS accountable  
Congressional lawmakers do have the power to ask federal agencies tough questions â and that doesnât require much political capital, as itâs their job. Get America CoveredÂ co-founderÂ Joshua Peck worked at HHS during the Obama administration and knows firsthand that members can and did request documents to see if the agencyâs decisions were in sync with the law. 
 
âI think they have a lot of power to hold HHS accountable for the decisions that they are making right now,â Peck told ThinkProgress. This includes asking HHS what was considered and what criteria was used when deciding to cut marketing for open enrollment? Heâd ask similar questions about cuts to the navigator program and the shortening of the enrollment period. 
     MIAMI, FL - MAY 12:  Peter Yanez, who is insured under a policy from the Affordable Care Act, has his blood pressure measured by Linda Williams, a medical assistant, before getting a blood test at a Planned Parenthood health center on May 12, 2017 in Miami, Florida. A GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act would cut  federal funding for Planned Parenthood services at their health centers. Planned Parenthood has approximately 700 health centers across the country that serve 2,470,000 male and female patients and provide services for preventive health care, birth-control, cancer screeening, pregnancy tests and STD testing and treatment.

AvalereÂ Healthâs Chris Sloan, whoâs spent a lot of time studying ACA marketplaces country-wide, thinks that if lawmakers are going to pass any measure, it should be a federal reinsurance program. 
 
âIf you are sort of weighing political feasibility and effectiveness, that really seems like it comes out on top,â he said. 
 
The drawback, he noted, is that lawmakers have to fund it; meaning theyâll have to spend federal dollars on Obamacare. But any short fix would have to. 
 
âItâs tough to solve,â he said. âBut generally the solving will cost money.â 
 
Overall, Congress might want to devote more energy to alleviating headaches for people outside of the relatively small ACA marketplace too, especiallyÂ because lawmakers have already spent a great deal of their political capital on this. 
 
âThe ACA was a great success in reducing the number of people of uninsured, but most of that success came from expanding a program that already existed â Medicaid â and there were pretty dramatic political consequences for the people who did that,â said Sloan.</content>

    <content type="text">At my pediatric clinic, I often hear how my patients and their families struggle at pharmacies, forced to choose between paying for their prescriptions or their groceries. 
 
They are not alone: More than one in five patients cannot afford the medications prescribed by their health-care providers. This is even worse for Black and Latino families and seniors on fixed incomes , who often have even fewer dollars to stretch for prescriptions. 
 
Late last month, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) announced legislation called the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act , which intends to stop price gouging by allowing the federal government to approve cheaper versions of generic medications, thus stripping pharmaceutical corporations that refuse to lower prices of their monopolies. 
 
To show you how this policy would work, letâs use Advair as an example. As a pediatrician, I frequently prescribe this inhaler for my asthmatic patients. Under the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act , the s ecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would establish a process to first compare the United Statesâ excessively priced brand-name drugs with the prices of those same drugs in five wealthy countries: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada. In 2015, the median costâor middle priceâfor a monthâs supply of Advair in these five countries was $46.99. In the good olâ US of A, which lacks the regulations that other countries use to keep drug prices down, it cost $154.80, and thatâs after discounts . This domestic price-gouging by the GlaxoSmithKline corporation is literally making it harder for my young patients to breathe.

Based on this price information, the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act would dictate to GlaxoSmithKline that the maximum price they could charge would be $46.99, the median in the other wealthy countries. If GSK refused to lower the price, then the U.S. government would issue competitive licenses to any company that wanted to produce a generic version of Advair and sell it at or below $46.99. 
 
Competitive licensing, sometimes called compulsory licensing, has been used around the world for decades and are approved under U.S. trade law in order to maintain access to needed medications when high prices are restricting that access. What this means is that the legislation would put patents, not patients, at risk. If a drug company tried to restrict access, another company could produce a generic version. 
 
Importantly, the international reference price is not the only way a price could be termed excessive. The Prescription Drug Price Relief Act would allow any person in this country to lodge a complaint with an office within HHS that a drug price is excessive. Then by using multiple criteria âincluding but not restricted to the international reference priceâHHS would deem if the drug is excessively priced. 
 
The government would also maintain a publicly available database listing brand-name drugs, their prices in the United States, and how those prices compare to other countries. Every big pharmaceutical corporation would be required to report to the HHS about domestic and international pricing for the brand-name drugs they manufacture. Failure to report would result in financial penalties to Big Pharma, and the money would go to competitive research grant programs at the National Institutes of Health, who already do nearly all the research on new drugs and devices. 
 
Many public health experts and consumer advocates anticipate that under the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act, a big pharmaceutical corporation like GlaxoSmithKline would opt to drop the price of drugs like Advair instead of losing their patents and sales to a generic drug company. 
 
Getting prescriptions filled should not be another challenge for my patients and their families who are already struggling with asthma, diabetes, depression, cancer, and many other illnesses. The Prescription Drug Price Relief Act would provide some overdue peace of mind because it puts patients before profits. Even if this legislation doesnât pass in 2019, it sets a bold marker on what transformative legislation needs to look like. Policies rooted in health justice should lower everyoneâs drug prices and never put peopleâs access to medicine at risk. Instead, smart policies put a drug corporationâs patent at risk. 
 
It is up to us, the ordinary people struggling in an unjust health system, to put pressure on all of our elected officials to pass policies like the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act. Illness and disease do not care if you are a Republican or Democrat. All of us have a human right to health care and accessible prescriptions regardless of what we look like, where we live, or how we vote. Together, we can push legislators to put patients before politics and profits.

    <content type="text">LAS COLINAS, Texas &amp; SAN FRANCISCO: McKesson Corporation has issued the following press release:  McKesson Corporation, which has been investing in technologies and services that create more efficiencies for healthcare providers, and Augmedix, a technology-enabled service for health systems and providers, announced the expansion of an innovative pilot between the Augmedix electronic health record (EHR) documentation platform and the McKesson oncology EHR iKnowMedSM.  New pilot programs are beginning with Virginia Cancer Specialists (VCS) and Virginia Oncology Associates (VOA), both practices in The US Oncology Network. The goal of the pilot is to provide more time for the physicians to meet and communicate with their cancer patients. Augmedix outfits physicians with Glass eyewear from Alphabet's moonshot factory. The wearable technology is then used during patient exams, which streams audio/visual information from the clinic visit to an off-site team of tech-enabled scribes in a HIPAA-secure location. Trained scribes assist the physician and perform EHR documentation in real-time, saving the physician precious time. The physician then reviews and approves notes for the EHR. The system is dynamic in that the Augmedix team can communicate information back to the physicianâs display on Glass. Augmedix also offers a smartphone-based solution for physicians who prefer not to use the Glass device.  VCS has utilized iKnowMed for more than six years as the EHR offers fast, easy sharing across the spectrum of care with the practiceâs many systems through best-in-class interoperability. iKnowMed provides support in value-based care programs such as the Oncology Care Model (OCM), the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and other programs while improving the practiceâs efficiency. This EHR platform is in use by approximately 2,200 providers in 175 practices across approximately 650 sites of care and it contains more than 6.5 million patient records documenting over 115 million patient visits. iKnowMed has been named the top-ranked EHR platform for oncologists and hematologists for seven years in a row by Black BookTM Research, an unbiased, industry-leading source for polling, surveys and market research.  âWeâve enjoyed the ease of use and rich information available in the iKnowMed EHR, and augmenting iKnowMed with Augmedixâs technology makes it even more powerful,â said Alexander I. Spira, M.D., medical oncologist with VCS. âI love that I can give more focus to observing and truly caring for my cancer patients. Not having to input all of my notes myself saves me time, making me more accessible and allowing me to treat a few more patients each day.â  Augmedixâs first deployment with The Network was in Willamette Valley Cancer Institute (WVCI) and Research Center based in Eugene, Oregon. In addition to WVCI, VCS and VOA, further use and adoption are anticipated at more oncology practices in The US Oncology Network next year.</content>

    <content type="text">I have had the fortune â both good and bad â of being at the forefront of reforming physician reimbursement as an advocate for physicians. Iâve worked on models spanning private practice, group employment, faculty practice plans, andÂ  independent physician associations . 
Itâs been a bruising journey. 

There were the old ways âÂ  relative value units Â (RVUs) and other tortured renditions of volume medicine â that created a lingering culture of compression in which the only way HMOs could continue to squeeze out profits over time was to pay less for services. These contrived value units created a system that could reward only a continuous churn of transactional patient visits rather than rewarding improving patientsâ health. 
 
In the 1990s, physician reimbursement models inadequately applied the concepts of capitation and risk adjustment. When they resurfaced in the latestÂ  value-based-care Â efforts, they sent physicians fleeing for the door crying, in âPoltergeistâ-fashion, âTheyâre baaaack!â 
 
Considering our pasts, our mistrust of the reimbursement systemÂ â of hospital administrations, of academic departmental models, and, of course, of the insurance industry to fairly compensate primary care physicians (PCPs) â is appropriately enormous. Most ânewâ reimbursement methods remain based in volume, with relatively small incentives for check-the-box successes that donât truly amount to a paradigm shift toward value-based reimbursement. Those that do adjust payments away from fee-for-service often donât recognize and reward the value of primary care providers. 
 
These physicians, who are vital links in the chain of health care, have virtually zero control in the current system on how and how much they get paid. 
 
The system has predecided that primary care services are worth approximately 6 cents of every health care dollar. That is a small sliver of the pie in exchange for the expectation of being patientsâ care quarterbacks across multiple clinical caregiversâ and even more egregious should the primary care role evolve, as is logical, into also quarterbacking cross-community social determinant and wellbeing initiatives in addition to providing clinical care. 
 
I have heard the gripes and met the resistance over the years from insurance plans, systems, hospitals, and physicians. I have also been able to help develop and implement progressive physician compensation models that appropriately reward physicians not just for treating those who walk in the door but for collaborating on treatment models that encourage fewer people to walk in the door â models that truly encourage cross-caregiver collaboration and reward value in medicine rather than volume. These have proven themselves to offer much larger upside potential for primary care physicians than the ceiling weâve already hit on speed and volume. 
 
In every flavor of payment models I have worked with, Iâve had to assume I cannot change the insurance industry. But IÂ canÂ affect the spoons that actually feed us as physicians, especially as more physicians become affiliated or employed. 
 
In working with leading providers in New York, California, and other states in between, Iâve learned after many arguments that most compensation methods are currently misaligned, meaning they pay physicians for transactional, volume-based care but they ask those physicians to practice value-based health care. Properly aligning compensation with work is the key, but that means many things to multiple stakeholders, all with varying expectations and timelines. 
 
Alignment between pay and care occurs when physicians are rewarded for activities that promote their patientsâ overall health and wellness and for managing chronic disease. In an aligned pay-care scenario, physicians are rewarded when youÂ donâtÂ have a heart attack, not when you do. Wrapping oneâs head and oneâs payment system around such a concept is a challenge. 
 
When alignment isnât achieved, we end up sliding back to the familiar: The devil you know is better than the devil you donât, and volume-based addition is at least easy to understand and administer. 
 
From multiple attempts to engineer value-based care models that value primary care physicians, here are six lessons Iâve learned. 
 
One question matters. Â The only question that should ultimately matter to primary care physicians is this: âFor how many risk-adjusted patients are you providing high-quality care?â The new widget in town is the holistic person, not an RVU or anÂ  evaluation/management code . 
 
The rules of the game must change.Â  Primary care physicians got really good at the volume game. We learned to play by the perverse rules handed to us by HMOs. This isnât a pejorative statement â playing the game was protective. I am confident that when we all understand the new rules for creating value in health care, we will learn how to succeed there, too. Yet the upside should not have an arbitrary ceiling. A piece of the savings that primary care providers help generate should be reserved for them. The same percentage of a bigger pie is, well, more pie. The burnout factor for doing more for less is real. We can change this. 
 
Adequate risk-adjustment is an absolute.Â  Risk adjustment is a lesson from the 1990s that still haunts us. Stratifying patients only by age and sex does little to indicate the cost of care. Primary care physicians were unable to provide the time that very sick patients needed, and this poor risk adjustment was the inherent driver of cherry-picking patients. With data-informed risk stratification and risk adjustment that account for social determinants of health as well as treatment across providers, we can actually entice physicians to reach for the sicker and frailer by rewarding them for doing so. 
 
Change practice operating models.Â  Incrementalism may not only slow us down, it may cause us to fail. Value-based care is about more fluid communication, prevention, reminders for adherence, and at-the-time help, not episodic, infrequent, and fragmented interaction. But new tools are needed to support these new workflows and improved access to wraparound services. Quarterbacking cannot be conflated with just doing more. And that means weâll need to build new compensation models that reward the outcomes we all seek for our communities. 
 
Weatherproof the cracks. Â Problems will occur, so arm yourself with the tools to fix them. Success in newer models requires clinical informatics as well as population- and patient-level analytics to maximize the efforts of everyone on the care team and ensure few-to-none fall through the cracks. 
 
Trust is the final frontier.Â  Innovative reimbursement methods require a level of transparency that most payers have been unwilling to share. Transparency is a contractual must. I always say, out loud and often, that if primary care providers do not perceive absolute transparency into data and methods, then they shouldnât agree to a contract with the payer. Donât trust the negotiators, no matter how nice they are. Trust the numbers. 
 
Like many physicians, I know the post-traumatic stress disorder generated by 1990s capitation. But times are different. We now have far better data and analytics; we can adjust risk to provide for increased payments for patients who have overlapping conditions that complicate treatment, or whose age or disease progression make them more expensive to treat. Current capitation methods allow for fairer environments in which to run a primary care practice, and for the potential to increase revenues by addressing existing systemic inefficiencies. 
 
Ideally, our health care system would do a better job at keeping people healthier. But since that means that the market for primary care physicians would shrink considerably, then those physicians can achieve higher pay only through greater efficiency. And that means we need to find a better path forward for physician reimbursement.

    <content type="text">Mr. President:

Today, I'd like to raise an important issue that has impacted many families in Iowa and throughout the country: the high cost of prescription drugs.

One contributing factor that has played a part in how much money the government and taxpayer pays for some drugs is a government program called the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.

On Tuesday, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Wyden of Oregon. The bill, called the Right Rebate Act of 2018, would close a loophole in that program. As a condition for participation in Medicaid, drug companies must pay a rebate, or discount, to the federal government and states for the drugs they offer.

Generally speaking, the rebate dollar amount is less for a generic drug than for a brand-name drug.

The rebate program simply hasn't worked as designed. It turns out that some drug companies have been able to game the system to boost their bottom line at taxpayer expense.

Some drug companies have paid smaller rebates to the government. And that means taxpayers are footing a bigger burden.

There is one example in particular that highlights the main issues that we aim to solve with this legislation.

During the Obama administration, Iowans regularly contacted me by phone, email and at my annual 99 county meetings about the difficulties they faced paying for the EpiPen.

EpiPen is an emergency medicine used to treat severe, life-threatening allergic reactions. EpiPen is distributed by a company called Mylan.

In 2007, a pack of two EpiPens cost $100.

By 2016, the cost exploded to more than $600.

That is a substantial price increase. Many would argue that it's an unjustified price increase. Especially considering the gut punch to taxpayers who foot the lion's share of the Medicaid bill for families in need.

I listened to the concerns of my constituents and began to investigate how the drug rebate program was working.

In a nutshell, Mylan had classified the EpiPen as a generic drug in the Medicaid program when it should've been classified as a brand drug.

That means, Mylan misclassified EpiPen and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) let it happen.

Because of this incorrect classification, Mylan paid a much smaller rebate than they should have paid.

I asked the Health and Human Services Inspector General to look into these classification practices.

The Inspector General found that the taxpayers may have overpaid for the EpiPen by as much as $1.27 billion over 10 years because of the incorrect classification.

Eventually, Mylan settled a False Claims Act case with the Justice Department for $465 million.

Upon learning of that settlement, I expressed my disappointment that it didn't seem the taxpayers had been made whole.

We shouldn't have to depend on lawyers and lawsuits to get taxpayer money back.

This deception should never have happened in the first place.

Government agencies should, as an initial matter, be responsibly overseeing the programs that they are in charge of.

Because of insufficient attention to the problem by HHS, Mylan escaped accountability for a long time costing taxpayers billions of dollars.

But it's not just Mylan and the EpiPen.

In a December 2017 report, the Inspector General found that 885 drugs may have been potentially misclassified.

Specifically, the Inspector General found that from 2012 to 2016, Medicaid may have lost $1.3 billion in rebates for 10 potentially-misclassified drugs with the highest total reimbursement.

So where do we go from here?

It's clear the law must change to provide clarity. Let's establish clear lines of authority to hold the government and the private sector accountable.

Taxpayers demand and deserve accountability.

Simply said, accountability will bring cost savings.

S. 3702, the Right Rebate Act, will shut down this loophole used by drug companies.

This legislation will prevent the misclassification of drugs in the first place and protect taxpayer dollars.

It does this by requiring HHS to enforce penalties on drug companies that knowingly misclassify drugs in the Medicaid program.

The legislation also provides remedies for States that are shortchanged by drug companies.

The legislation requires an annual report to Congress by HHS to make sure the agency is doing all that it can do to protect taxpayer dollars and keep drug expenditures down.

Mr. President, this is common sense legislation. It would close a loophole used by drug companies to keep prices artificially higher than they should be and it grants the Secretary of HHS the authorities to properly enforce the law.

The Right Rebate Act is only one step in the fight against high prescription drug costs. But, it's the right step.

I look forward to working with Senator Wyden in the 116th Congress on many issues important to Americans, including the high cost of prescription drugs.

I yield the floor.

    <content type="text">Alec Burlakoff, one of the former top sales executives at Insys Therapeutics Inc., was forced to listen in a Boston courtroom as federal prosecutors read aloud the crimes he and the company had allegedly committed.Â  These claimed, âInsys had bribed doctors and their employees with payments for sham medical events that often turned out to be parties.Â  Physicians who didnât write prescriptions for the companyâs powerful opioid were cut off from the companyâs money.Â  There were lavish dinners, strip club visits and gun range outings, all of which led to booming sales of one of the worldâs most powerful â and dangerous â pain drugs.âÂ  There was even more evidence that the prosecutors had left out, according to Burlakoffâs attorneys, and their client was prepared to plead guilty. 
 
Burlakoff is one of the first drug-company executives charged in the opioid crisis , which was tied to about 50,000 deaths last year according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Â  He will face up to 20 years in prison.Â  However, the former executive has a cooperation agreement with the government, so itâs unclear how much time he will serve. 
 
Insys could also go underwater as the company continues to spend millions to defend its former executives, including billionaire founder and ex-chief executive John Kapoor.Â  Insysâs new managers are trying to sell off its main pain drug to a corporate buyer to raise money, hoping to use the proceeds to shift from opioids to cannabis-derived drugs.

âThereâs no guarantee the process will yield any results,â Insys spokesperson Joe McGrath said. âWe havenât found a buyer â and we might not.âÂ  The company indicated in a November 9 regulatory filing that it could also try to raise funds through debt, equity offerings or other means. 
 
Insysâs main product is Subsys, a spray version of the dangerous opioid fentanyl.Â  When it was introduced in the U.S. in 2012, the drug cost between $3,000 and $16,000 a month, depending on the dose and the Food and Drug Administration allowed the company to only market it to cancer patients. 
 
However, Kapoor and other executives essentially bribed doctors to prescribe it for non-cancer chronic pain and back aches, and defrauded insurance providers who were reluctant to approve prescriptions.Â  Some physicians were paid as much as $200,000, prosecutors said at the Nov. 28 hearing at which Burlakoff pleaded guilty.Â  With this business move, Subsys sales increased drastically from $8.6 million when it launched in March 2012 to $329.5 million in 2015.Â  The drug was also quickly diverted to the black market and sold on the streets, leading to numerous overdoses. 
 
In June 2015, a Connecticut nurse pleaded guilty to federal charges of accepting more than $83,000 in kickbacks.Â  And, indictments of doctors, nurses, sales representatives, and, eventually, Insys executives soon followed.Â  The company agreed to a $150 million settlement with the Department of Justice to resolve a civil and criminal investigation. 
 
The company has new board directors, âa new management team and employees committed to a culture of compliance, ethics and integrity, all aligned around a vision focused on the interests of patients.Â  Suits involving the company mostly pertain to allegations of past misdeeds by former employees,â Insys said in a written statement.

    <content type="text">The Maine Senate Democrats issued the following news on behalf of Maine State Sen. Heather Sanborn, D-Portland:

Earlier today, Democratic Senator Heather Sanborn of Portland was sworn into the Maine Senate. Sen. Sanborn was elected to her first term in the Senate in November. Chief Justice Leigh Saufley administered the oath of office to Sen. Sanborn and 32 of her Senate colleagues, all of whom have been elected to serve two-year terms. Sen. Sanborn represents part of Portland and part of Westbrook.

"As health care costs continue to spin out of control, Maine people are looking to leaders at the state-level in search of much-needed relief. This session, we must work together to identify innovative solutions to lower the cost of prescription drugs and insurance premiums," said Sen. Sanborn. "While I'm honored to have this opportunity to serve in the Maine Senate, I'm eager to get to work."

A former public school teacher and attorney, Sen. Sanborn now owns and runs Rising Tide Brewing Company with her husband in Portland. Under her leadership, Rising Tide has created two dozen jobs and helped spur the revitalization of the East Bayside neighborhood of Portland.

Sen. Sanborn has also served for many years on the Portland Development Corporation board, a quasi-municipal organization that administers the city's economic development revolving loan funds and job creation grant programs. She previously served in the Maine House of Representatives, where she was Co-Chair of the Legislature's Health Care Task Force.

Sen. Sanborn resides in Portland with her husband Nathan and teenage son.

Of the 35 senators, there are 21 Democrats and 14 Republicans. Twelve are women and 23 are men. There are 13 new members: 11 have recently served in the House of Representatives and two have no previous legislative experience. Twenty-two members are incumbents.

"I look forward to working with my new colleagues in the Maine Senate to increase the health and well-being of Maine people. This means increasing immunization rates among children, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and holding insurance companies accountable."

Sen. Sanborn practiced family medicine in Gorham for 25 years before retiring in 2007. Following her retirement from medicine, she was elected to the Maine House of Representatives, where she served two terms on the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee and two terms on the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee.

    <content type="text">The National Taxpayers Union issued the following news release:

More than 150 economists have signed a joint letter organized by the National Taxpayers Union (https://www.ntu.org/publications/page/foreign-drug-price-controls-bad-for-patients-bad-for-taxpayers) to the Department of Health and Human Services in opposition to its proposal to link government reimbursements for certain Medicare drugs to a foreign price index to establish domestic drug prices. This concept, tantamount to importing foreign price controls, would be bad for patients and taxpayers, leading to drug shortages and stagnant innovation. In the letter, the economists write,

Implementing a reference pricing system in the United States would create price controls that bring with them the same types of harms these policies have caused in foreign countries, to the detriment of the health care system at large and investments in U.S. research and development. History has shown that price controls on any commodity or service produce unintended but consistently detrimental effects.

A new issue brief from NTU President Pete Sepp (https://www.ntu.org/publications/page/foreign-drug-price-controls-bad-for-patients-bad-for-taxpayers) details numerous ways to address drug prices - streamlined regulations for the Federal Drug Administration as well as implementing better oversight over government health programs that artificially increase the prices for prescription drugs. In another example from the analysis, Sepp writes,

Value-based health care has more potential than any other model for delivering what free-market public policy advocates have long sought: stronger patient-provider relationships, consumers empowered with decision-making over how to deploy resources, limited government interference in the evolution of services, and nimble programs capable of embracing evidence-based results... This will foster an organic fiscal responsibility that is far more durable than complex rules, price controls, or rationing.

To speak with NTU President Pete Sepp, who helped organize the economists' letter and has proposed real solutions rather than foreign price controls, please contact NTU Vice President of Communications Kevin Glass at 703-299-8670 or at kglass@ntu.org

    <published>2018-12-07T14:36:58Z</published>
    <content type="text">The U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Andrew E. Lelling, issued the following news release:

The U.S. Attorney's Office announced today that pharmaceutical company Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion), a seller of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drugs, has agreed to pay $360 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by paying kickbacks to Medicare patients through a purportedly independent charitable foundation.

When a Medicare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug covered by Medicare Part B or Part D, the beneficiary may be required to make a partial payment, which may take the form of a co-payment, co-insurance, or deductible (collectively "co-pays"). These co-pay obligations may be substantial for expensive medications. Congress included co-pay requirements in these programs, in part, to encourage market forces to serve as a check on health care costs, including the prices that pharmaceutical manufacturers can demand for their drugs. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits pharmaceutical companies from offering or paying, directly or indirectly, any remuneration - which includes money or any other thing of value - to induce Medicare patients to purchase the companies' drugs. Actelion sells a number of PAH drugs, including Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri, and Opsumit. As part of today's settlement, the government alleged that Actelion used a foundation as a conduit to pay the co-pay obligations of thousands of Medicare patients taking Actelion's PAH drugs. By doing so, the government alleged, Actelion was able to induce patients to purchase its drugs when the prices Actelion had set for those drugs otherwise could have posed a barrier to purchases.

The government alleges that in 2014 and 2015, Actelion routinely obtained data from the foundation detailing how many patients on each Actelion drug the foundation had assisted, how much the foundation had spent on those patients, and how much the foundation expected to spend on those patients in the future. Actelion used this information to budget for future payments to the foundation on a drug-specific basis and to confirm that its contribution amounts to the foundation were sufficient to cover the copays of patients taking Actelion's drugs, but not of patients taking other manufacturers' PAH drugs. Actelion engaged in this practice even though the foundation warned the company against receiving data concerning the foundation's expenditures on copays for Actelion's drugs. Meanwhile, the government also alleged that Actelion had a policy of not permitting Medicare patients to participate in its free drug program, which was open to other financially needy patients, even if those Medicare patients could not afford their copays for Actelion's drugs. Instead, to generate revenue from Medicare and induce purchases of its drugs, the government alleged that Actelion referred such Medicare patients to the foundation, which allowed the patients' copays to be paid and resulted in claims to Medicare for the remaining cost.

"Using data from a foundation that it knew it should not have, Actelion effectively set up a proprietary fund to cover the co-pays of just its own drugs," said United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling. "Such conduct not only violates the anti-kickback statute, it also undermines the Medicare program's co-pay structure, which Congress created as a safeguard against inflated drug prices. During the period covered by today's settlement, Actelion raised the price of its main PAH drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of overall inflation in the United States."

"This settlement, as do prior settlements concerning similar misconduct, make clear that the government will hold accountable drug companies that pay illegal kickbacks," said Assistant Attorney General Joseph H. Hunt of the Department Justice's Civil Division. "Pharmaceutical companies cannot have it both ways--they cannot continue to increase drug prices while engaging in conduct designed to defeat the mechanisms that Congress designed to check such prices and then expect Medicare to pay for the ballooning costs."

"Kickback schemes can undermine our healthcare system, compromise medical decisions, and waste taxpayer dollars," said Phillip Coyne, Special Agent in Charge, Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Service's Boston Regional Office. "We will continue to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for subverting the charitable donation process in order to circumvent safeguards designed to protect the integrity of the Medicare program."

"Today's settlement against Actelion is a victory for the public and underscores the FBI's commitment to safeguarding the financial integrity of the Medicare program," said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division. "Simply put, the goal of the FBI's Health Care Fraud program is to ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatments and therapies according to their medical needs, without corrupt or profit-driven influence of drug manufacturers."

On June 16, 2017, after the conduct alleged in today's settlement agreement, Johnson &amp; Johnson acquired Actelion. Johnson &amp; Johnson was not involved, directly or indirectly, in the alleged conduct and the allegations above do not relate in any way to Johnson &amp; Johnson.

U.S. Attorney Lelling, Assistant Attorney General Hunt, HHS-OIG SAC Coyne, and FBI SAC Shaw made the announcement today. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service also assisted with the investigation. The matter was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Gregg Shapiro and Abraham George, of Lelling's Office, and by Trial Attorneys Augustine Ripa and Sarah Arni of the Justice Department's Civil Division.

    <content type="text">MEDICAL doctors at public hospitals went on strike at the weekend over salaries, allowances and drug shortages. The doctors have raised issues of high transport costs, fuel shortages, acute scarcity of vital medicines and basic theatre sundries, skyrocketing food prices and the state's total disregard of previous agreements. They want their salaries to be paid in United States dollars and their vehicle loan scheme revised. 
 
Candid Comment
Faith ZABA
fzaba@zimind.co.zw 
 
This is not the first time that medical doctors have embarked on industrial action. Earlier this year, the doctors went on strike for a month and only resumed duty after government pledged a salary hike, as well as improved working conditions. On Wednesday, government failed to reach an agreement with the doctors representatives, who accused their employer of ignoring their grievances, citing legal issues. 
 
The doctors strike is a clear reflection of the country's collapsing health delivery system. The year 2018 will be remembered as one of the worst for Zimbabweans, as the country's health delivery system continued to deteriorate. The sharp increase in drug prices and general medical costs in the past three months has made healthcare unaffordable and inaccessible to the pauperised majority. 
 
Prices of life-saving drugs have more than tripled, putting at high risk the lives of millions of Zimbabweans. The country has been hit by a critical drugs shortage caused by foreign currency scarcities, which have seen most pharmacies running out of essential medicines, including medication for chronic diseases, which are responsible for at least 50% of total deaths that occur worldwide. Where the drugs are available, pharmacies are charging exorbitant prices in US dollars, which are multiplied by a minimum 300% in Real Time Gross Settlements (RTGS) or the bond currency. These charges are just ridiculous in a country where formal unemployment is more than 90% and the majority of the formally employed earn less than $500. As healthcare costs continue to spiral, more people seem to be skipping physician visits, while less are visiting doctors. This has ultimately led to fatal repercussions. Skipping and delaying medical attention subsequently impacts on the quality of care and outcome. 
 
Government needs to prioritise health care. While we celebrate the construction of the parliament building in Mt Hampden, whose construction is financed by the Chinese at a cost of US$676,5 million, through a grant, it is astounding that the same government lost a grant to build a state-of-the-art national pharmaceutical warehouse due to bureaucratic red tape and lack of policy cohesion. The US$25 million grant, which was availed after the two governments signed an agreement in 2015, has since been returned to Beijing. This just shows that healthcare has never been a top priority for government. If it had been, then some public hospitals would not have become death traps. 
 
Government cannot continue to pay a deaf ear to these problems, they will not go away. What the country needs is world-class hospitals, which are well-equipped and resourced. In the short-term, the government must avail foreign currency to the health sector as a top priority.</content>

    <content type="text">A nd so, another working week will soon draw to a close. Not a moment too soon, yes? This is, you may recall, our treasured signal to daydream about weekend plans. Our agenda is rather modest. We hope to catch up on a backlog of reading, spend time with our short people, and promenade with the official mascots. We can all use the exercise. And what about you? This is a good time to winterize your castle or boost the economy and buy a sweater. You can plan a quick getaway now that holiday season is here. Or if you are feeling brave, you could forecast the impact those tariffs may have on your budget. Well, whatever you do, have a grand time. But be safe. Enjoy, and see you soon â¦ 

Total retail prescription-drug spending, which is spending on drugs at a retail outlet or a physician office, rose 0.4 percent in 2017, compared with an increase of 2.3 percent in 2016. This was down from a 12.4 percent in 2014. And total spending last year was $333.4 billion, The Wall Street Journal writes, citing a report byÂ the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which wasÂ published in Health Affairs.Â The deceleration in the rate of prescription drug spending was due, in part, to lower insulin prices in 2017 and a decline in spending on pain medications such as opioids.</content>

    <content type="text">A Swiss drugmaker is challenging a 2011 change to the law that no longer allows a company to patent an invention if it was for sale for more than a year before filing a patent application. Meanwhile, Congress also plans to focus on the issue of pharmaceutical patents and lawmakers continue to question the industry's pricing decisions. And as Capitol Hill gears up for potential action on drug costs, there may be some lessons to be learned from China. 
  
 Stat:
						Supreme Court To Decide Patent Case With Implications For Small Drug MakersÂ   
In a few months, the U.S. Supreme Court will decide a closely watched case that could lead to patents being canceled more easily and, therefore, chill deals that small drug makers may pursue in hopes of finding larger partners to get their medicines to market. The case turns on disputed language in U.S. patent law, which was overhauled in 2011, that prohibits a company from patenting an invention if it was for sale for more than a year before filing a patent application. The court, which heardÂ oral arguments on Tuesday, must decide whether Congress intended the law to apply only to agreements that are publicly known or also encompasses confidential transactions out of the public eye. (Silverman, 12/6)

						Democrats Are Eyeing A Valuable Pharma Asset: Its PatentsÂ   
Democrats, newly empowered in D.C. and on the hunt for bigger and bolder ways to lower drug prices, are suddenly taking aim at a far more central part of pharmaâs monopoly power: the patents the industry holds on its drugs. For years, lawmakers from both parties have shied away to address the industryâs intellectual property. Muck with a drug companyâs government-granted monopoly, the thinking goes, and investments in research and development will disappear. Pharma even helped to scuttle a broad, bipartisan patent reform effort in 2015, in part because the industry worried that even small changes focused on bad actors would open the door to bigger ones. (Facher, 12/7) 
   
 The Wall Street Journal:
						Congress To Drug Makers: Why Stock Buybacks Over Lowered Drug Prices?  
Critics of high drug prices are launching a new line of attack against manufacturers of the medicines, faulting the firms for using savings from the tax overhaul to buy back shares rather than lower prices. The attacks began in October, when more than a dozen Democrats in the House of Representatives sent letters to five big pharmaceutical companies saying they had benefited from recent tax cuts but kept charging high prices. The letters singled out certain drugs whose list prices had increased and asked their manufacturers for details about price changes and the costs of research and advertising. (Loftus, 12/6) 
   
 The Wall Street Journal:
						Solving Chinaâs Drugs-Price Problem Is Hurting Drugmakers  
Chinaâs cure for its health-care problems is causing plenty of pain for drugmakers. Just as in the U.S., expensive prescription drugs have long been a headache in China. Government insurance usually doesnât cover the full price of drugs for patients, so many have to pay a hefty portion out of their own pockets, especially those with serious diseases. In its latest bid to lower medicine costs, the Chinese government recently asked drugmakers to bid for the right to supply hospitals in 11 major cities, including Shanghai and Beijing. The winners will be those willing to accept the lowest prices. Hospitals are the biggest buyers of drugs in China, accounting for 68% of the $200 billion market, according to health-data company Iqvia. (Wong, 12/7)

						Generic Drugmaker To Sell Alternative To EpiPen Injectors  
Generic drugmaker Sandoz announced plans Thursday to start selling an alternative to the EpiPen in the U.S. early next year. The EpiPen injector is used to halt life-threatening allergic reactions to insect bites, nuts and other foods. Brand-name EpiPen, which dominates the market, has been in short supply since spring because of production problems. (Johnson, 12/6)

						Roche's Lung Cancer Combo Treatment Wins FDA Approval

The drug on Wednesday had also won priority review from the U.S. regulator for treating patients with untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. (12/6)

The U.S. Department of Justice said the company illegally used the foundation to cover copay costs for thousands of patients in violation of the False Claims Act. The federal anti-kickback statute prevents pharmaceutical companies from providing financial coverage of those copay payments. The government said Actelion used the non-profit foundation âas an illegal conduit to pay the copay obligations of thousands of Medicare patientsâ who were taking its PAH treatments, which include Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri and Opsumit.

Over a period of months between 2014 and 2015, Actelion made donations to the nonprofit foundation, which, in turn, used those donations to pay copays of patients prescribed treatments, the government said. Actelion, the government charged, obtained data from the foundation regarding the amount of money it spent to support the copays of those patients in order to confirm that its donations to the foundation were sufficient. Additionally, the government said the foundation had warned Actelion that it could be in violation of the law. Also, the Department of Justice said Actelion had a policy of not permitting Medicare patients to participate in its free drug program even if those Medicare patients could not afford their copays for the PAH drugs. The free drug program was open to other patients, the government said. Instead, to generate revenue from Medicare and induce purchases of the PAH drugs, the government alleged that Actelion referred such Medicare patients to the foundation, which allowed the patients' copays to be paid and resulted in claims to Medicare for the remaining cost. 

In 2017, Johnson &amp; Johnson dropped $30 billion in cash to acquire the Switzerland-based Actelion and its PAH drugs. At the time of the deal, Tracleer brought in about 50 percent of the companyâs revenue. As part of the settlement, Actelion did not admit any wrongdoing.

United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said Actelion âeffectively set up a proprietary fundâ to cover the copays of its own drugs. He said that not only violates the anti-kickback statute, but also undermined the copay structure allowed by Medicare. Additionally, Lelling said that during the time covered by the settlement, âActelion raised the price of its main PAH drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of overall inflation in the United States.â

Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justiceâs Civil Division, said the $360 million settlement makes clear that the government will hold companies accountable for participation in illegal kickback schemes.

âPharmaceutical companies cannot increase drug prices while engaging in conduct designed to defeat mechanisms put in place to check such prices and then expect Medicare to pay for the ballooning costs,â Hunt said in a statement.

Actelion isnât the only company that has been accused of using charitable foundations to make money. Earlier this year, Jazz Pharma regarding its support of 501(c)(3) organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients. In December United Therapeutics disclosed that it had set aside into its support of similar charitable giving programs -- support that the government called a kickback. Two years ago Celgene was accused of donating millions to charities that help patients afford high-priced drugs for cancer as part of a scheme to turn a profit of billions of dollars.</content>

    <content type="text">Recently, there has been a robust discussion of an October Trump administration proposal that Medicare pay for certain prescription drugs based on an âinternational pricing indexâ determined by prices in Europe. This proposal followed a government study showing that Medicare was paying 80 percent more for many physician-administered drugs than other advanced industrialized countries. A recent fascinating article in Health Affairs by Martin Wenzl and Elias Mossialos notes that price differentials between the US and other advanced industrialized countries are much steeper for cardiac implant devices than even for drugs â prices are two to six times higher in the US than in Germany. 
 
The US â one of the largest markets for pharmaceuticals and medical devices in the world â is also one of the few industrialized countries that does not regulate device prices . According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission , medical devices are a major contributor to rising health care expenditures, and spending on devices has been increasing twice as fast annually as expenditures on drugs ( 4 to 5 percent versus 2 percent ). 
 
In both Europe and the US, policymakers are increasingly relying on medical device regulatory policies such as market approval mechanisms, post-market surveillance systems , reference pricing and, health technology assessments .Â  At the same time, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the harm that devices can cause, as powerfully documented by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in multiple examples of medical device failures worldwide in the recently released Implant Files . Â However, purchase prices of devices have received little public attention. 
 
In this post, we discuss reasons for medical device price differentials that might arise from countriesâ diverging regulatory frameworks, focusing especially on the case of drug-eluting stents. Additionally, we discuss new regulatory approaches that account for the value of devices in coverage and reimbursement decisions and could help improve device safety.Â Â  Â  
 
It is difficult to measure total expenditures on medical devices for a variety of reasons. Many devices are reimbursed through bundled payment mechanisms such as diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), and the device price is not listed. Also, purchase prices of devices by hospitals are part of proprietary negotiations in many countries, including the US and Germany. Early evidence from Navathe and colleagues on the recent bundled payment system introduced in the US for joint replacements shows that bundled payments reduce spending on joint implants. However, medical devices range from scalpels, to PET scans, to medical software, and are used in all sectors of the health care system, and precise quantification of device expenditures remains elusive. 
 
Wenzl and Mossialos provide an innovative investigation of medical device price differences between the US and Europe. They analyze hospital surveys conducted by the Millennium Research Group that provide quarterly country-specific data on prices of devices. They find large variation in prices between the US and Germany for different cardiovascular technologies. For example, prices for bare-metal stents and some types of pacemakers in 2014 were five times higher in the US compared to Germany. They also find price differences for bare-metal stents, drug-eluting stents, and single-chamber and dual-chamber pacemakers between, and even within, EU countries. 
 
To improve the efficiency of health care systems, it is important for stakeholders to better understand factors that might impact these large differences in medical device prices. Such an understanding would enable policymakers and payers to implement measures that control prices while accounting for the value of the device. 
 
There are many reasons for higher prices for medical devices in the US, similar to prescription drug pricing. Many European countries have advisory bodies and health authorities to help evaluate and determine which technologies are covered by publicly financed health care systems. Importantly, they negotiate or set reimbursement levels or prices for drugs and devices in order to operate within a budget, which does not occur on a national level at all in the US. The willingness to negotiate prices in Europe is likely related to the existence of publicly financed national health care systems and universal coverage in many EU countries, which, again, differs from the US. In France, England, and Germany , centralized bodies make coverage and reimbursement decisions after assessing the efficacy and/or clinical effectiveness of certain devices or broad device types or procedures. In Italy, coverage and reimbursement decisions are made by regional authorities. All four countries use prospective payment systems. For particularly innovative and expensive technologies, these countries also use supplementary payments, as DRGs might not actually reflect the costs of the device. 
 
A detailed review of Italian coverage and reimbursement decisions for drug-eluting stents shows that prices for these devices were included in a national price regulation list for maximum reimbursement in 2007. Cappellaro and colleagues showed that some regional authorities involved in the purchase process (for example, the Emilia Romagna Region) were able to negotiate significantly lower purchase prices compared to other regions. 
 
In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) evaluates new high-risk, and/or costly devices, such as drug-eluting stents. Besides limiting their use to a subgroup of patients meeting specific clinical criteria, NICE recommended that the devices should be covered only when the additional cost of the drug-eluting stent over a bare-metal stent is Â£300 or less - a policy which seems to be effective in slowing price increases. 
 
Another example is the Institute for the Hospital Remuneration System in Germany, which determines technologiesâ eligibility for supplementary payments in addition to DRG payments. Calculated by this Institute and listed in the appendix of the DRG classification, the supplementary payment for drug eluting stents decreased continuously from 693.11 Euro in 2009 to 235.94 Euro in 2014. Hospitals receiving these supplementary payments have an incentive to negotiate prices for drug-eluting stents that are similar to, or below, the reimbursement price. Therefore, a decrease in purchase prices might be expected. And indeed, Wenzl and Mossialos show that purchase prices in Germany are similar to prices of supplementary payments shown above. 
 
Some level of regulatory review is a prerequisite before medical devices can be marketed; decisions on coverage, pricing, and reimbursement then follow. However, in most of Europe and for most devices in the United States, market approval is not predicated on evidence of effectiveness (either alone, or in comparison to existing devices). The widely used 510k Food and Drug Administration clearance process for devices in the US only requires that they are âsubstantially equivalentâ to other devices, but safety and effectiveness are not criteria in this pathway and cannot be assured, as noted in an report by the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine). The EU plans to strengthen market approval by 2020 with, for example, stricter clinical evaluation requirements , especially for high-risk medical devices. However, market approval does notindicate that the device provides a meaningful, therapeutic benefit to most patients under real world conditions. Ideally, this benefit is examined during post-market assessments in comparison to existing alternatives. Linking these post-market results to coverage and reimbursement mechanisms might have a direct or indirect impact on prices set by manufacturers. 
 
This type of linkage is more common within a publicly-financed health care system, although could be used in privately financed systems as well. For example, Germany has increasingly focused on linking coverage and reimbursement decisions to assessments of patient-related end points, such as mortality, morbidity, or quality of life, relative to comparator interventions. Since 2016, the German Federal Joint Committee has been using this type of assessment as the basis for allowing additional innovation payments for certain new diagnostic and therapeutic methods involving high-risk medical devices. Only a proven benefit entitles hospitals to enter into price negotiations with insurers for these new devices. Technologies only showing a potential benefit but needing more evidence fall under a policy similar to the â coverage with evidence development â policy that Medicare and other insurers have used in the past decade. In these cases, further evidence is gathered in post-market clinical trials while the treatment is temporarily covered by payers. 
 
Another example is the legislative proposal issued by the European Commission to the European Council and Parliament in January 2018. The proposal would implement European-wide clinical assessment for technologies, including certain medical devices, while authority for coverage and reimbursement decisions would remain at the country level. The 28 member states may also consider other domains relevant for coverage and pricing decision-making in each country (for example, legal, ethical, socio-cultural, and organizational consequences). 
 
Compared to health care systems in Europe, the U.S. has a pluralistic system of many public and private plans, which provides opportunities but also presents challenges for coordinated value assessment. Every insurer has the opportunity to decide differently how medical devices are covered and reimbursed. Nevertheless, stakeholders are making some progress in normalizing the use of value assessment in coverage decisions about devices. For example, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review ( ICER ) â an independent research organization founded in 2006 â assesses the clinical and economic value of technologies and health care delivery innovations, convening stakeholders such as physicians, insurers and, the government to translate gathered evidence into a value framework. However, ICER primarily focuses on drugs, rather than medical devices. The National Evaluation System for Health Technology Coordinating Center ( NESTcc ) is a public-private partnership that aims to advance regulatory science for medical devices. It focuses on the establishment of a foundation for âtimely, reliable, and cost-effective development of real-world evidenceâ to enhance decision-making of regulatory bodies and clinical stakeholders. However, it is in early stages, and its work and the impact on value based decisions for devices remains to be determined. 
 
Wenzl and Mossialos provide strong evidence that medical device prices and expenditures should be considered under proposals to promote high value care. Transparency and price negotiations should be key elements of strategies to improve the value of care. In addition, current US efforts such as Medicareâs âcoverage with evidence developmentâ and multiple public and private value based purchasing strategies can help move the US toward more evidence based and value based payments. Such approaches must be evaluated to determine effects on patient care and on new development of beneficial therapies by manufacturers. There is a need for ongoing data collection regarding the effects of reimbursement and pricing decisions on patient access, expenditures, and affordability, as well as on safety and effectiveness of devices to promote access to high value health care.

A 70-year-old patient at Kaweah Delta Medical Center had his eye socket shattered in an attack by a roommate who hospital officials knew to be violent and schizophrenic, according to aÂ  state oversight agency report .Â  

In theÂ report released Thursday, the agency stated the hospital did not properly supervise the aggressive patient who had attacked before. 

TheÂ  California Department of Public Health fined the hospital $52,000 after finding Kaweah Delta failed to provide safety in the February 2018Â incident. The aggressor, 41, had already punched a doctor in the emergency room while being examined, and state investigators found that nurses and at least one doctor considered the man so threatening they did not enter his room to examine him. 

Hospital officials said Thursday they are focused on patient safety and have conducted training since the incident to be sure nothing like it happens again. 

The public health department fined six addition medical facilities for similar instances over a four-year period concluding this year. Kaweah Delta âs fine was the third highest of those fines and is the hospitalâs third "immediate jeopardy" penalty, the department said in a statement. 

The investigative report does not name any of the patients, doctors or nurses involved, referring to them instead by codes such as Patient 1 and Emergency Department Doctor 2. 

According to the investigative report, a patient showed up at the emergency room just before noon Monday, Feb. 26 saying he needed a mental health evaluation. The man, 41 years old, 6 feet 2 inches tallÂ and about 185 pounds, had served extensive time in prison, investigators later learned. 

Health department investigators wrote that he punched the first doctor who examined him, landing a closed-fist blow to the right side of the doctor's head. 

âWithout warning, the patient struck me,â the doctor wrote in his notes minutes later, according to investigators. 

The staff sounded a "Code Gray," an internal alert indicating a violent person. The patient was placed in restraints on all four extremities. 

A second doctor, brought in to finish the examination, reported the patient âposes a clear threat." Two more doctors, including a psychiatric resident, saw him and the last doctor ordered him admitted to the mental health hospital on Akers Street and Tulare Avenue. 

He was sedated before being transported by ambulance.Â

At 8:41 p.m,Â a charge nurse assigned him to the same room as the 70-year-old patient, who another nurse told investigators was recovering well from his own mental health crisis and had shown no signs of violence.Â The older patient had been admitted two weeks earlier. 

Investigators describe him as a slight 5 feet, 9 inches and 125 pounds. 

When the younger, violent patient arrived he was heavily sedated, according to hospital records examined by the investigators. On Monday night, he was unable to wake up to answer questions when a nurse tried to assess his condition.Â  

By Tuesday, however, nurses and doctors were concerned for their own safety in dealing with him, according to notes included in the state's investigative report. At 7:30 a.m. a nurse taking over his care was informed that he had punched the doctor and noted that he was pacing and "appears agitated," the report says. 

She reported checking on him from the doorway of the room because she was concerned about going inside. 

About two hours later, the report says, a multidisciplinary team gathered at the hospital to discuss patients' cases. The team formed two treatment plans for the 41-year-old man, but state investigators note that neither plan focused on his violent behavior. 

Shortly after, the psychiatric medical director checked on the manÂ â again from the doorway, investigators said. He noted a "defensive prison mentality" and judged it unsafe to get closer, according to the report 

By early evening, a nurse noted that the man appeared to be getting more agitated, and was pacing outside his room. He seemed, the nurse told investigators, to be "responding to internal stimuli." 

At 9:11 p.m. on Feb. 27, according to the report, the younger patient emerged from the room. "Man down!" he yelled, according to the investigators' report. 

The older patient came out immediately after: "That guy hit me.â 

Investigators described an unprovoked attack, and said the two men had not even interacted before it happened. A nurse later asked the younger man why he did it, according to the report. 

"I had a bad day," he said simply. 

The older patient had an orbital bone fracture and suffered lost vision in his left eye that had not recovered as of his discharge, the report stated. A week later, when interviewed by state investigators, he had a large bruise under his left eye, extending halfway down his cheek, the report said. 

Laura Florez-McCusker, Kaweah Delta Health Care District media relations director, said patient safety is a top priority at the hospital and the incident between the two patients was immediately reported. She also said hospital personnel received training stemming from the incident.Â  

âWe have carefully reviewed this incident with everyone involved, including our senior leadership, to learn from it, improve patient care, update our policies, and prevent future occurrences,â she said. âWe have taken significant steps including intensive training of staff and physicians to ensure that we are providing the highest level of care to patients.â 

Elsewhere in the Central Valley, Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield and Saint Agnes Medical Center in Fresno were alsoÂ fined.

    <content type="text">Dive Brief:   An accountable care organization's use of virtual healthcare led to 33% fewer in-person visits, but increased overall visits by 80%, according to a new study in Health Affairs. It also shed light on the potential for virtual visit programs to increase disparities in access to care.  Researchers reviewed data on 1,431 patients who registered with a virtual visit program at a Massachusetts-based ACO between October 2014 and February 2017. Of those, just over half (51%) completed at least one virtual visit.  Virtual visits were highest immediately after registration and dropped off as time went on, returning to baseline by the end of the study. Participants tended to be younger, white, English-speaking, commercially insured and needed to travel farther to reach the clinic than nonparticipants.                   Dive Insight:  
Virtual visits are often used to supplement costly in-person care, but to be truly disruptive and help achieve value-based care goals they need to actually replace in-person visits. This study shows in-person visits were replaced with virtual visits but only for a short duration.Â  
 
For every 3.5 virtual visits, one in-person visit was avoided, the study says. However, the benefits of the shift to virtual visits did not extend beyond a year, the study says. 
 
"This study provides ACO administrators with an estimate of the potential gains attainable through shared savings from reduced in-person visit billing that could offset the necessary investment," they write. "However, the diminishing effectiveness over time observed in this study cautions against assuming a long-lasting reduction in in-person visits, absent a change in program design."Â  
 
To increase access for patients while reducing costs, the researchers recommend three focal points. ACO-based virtual care programs should be construed to impact all medical costs, not just ambulatory care, and be measured against that goal. ACOs must make demonstration of the value of these programs a priority. And organizations must monitor the potential of virtual visit programs to exacerbate disparities.Â  
 
"Historically, new health interventions favor the well resourced, thereby widening socioeconomic disparities," the study says. "As virtual visit programs mature, special attention should be paid to promoting their use among traditionally marginalized patients such as members of racial and ethnic minority groups, the homebound, people with limited English proficiency, and those living in poverty." 
 
There's another obstacle organizations need to overcome in implementing virtual care programs. According to Deloitte, 23% of consumers said they had used video visits and more than half expressed a willingness to try them, but just 14% of doctors Â reported having video capabilities and 18% of those planned to add it in the next year or two.</content>

    <content type="text">Nurses should initiate financial conversations with patients early and offer resources to improve access to cancer care, speakers at the  ONS Center for Advocacy and Health Policyâs third annual policy summit on November 13, 2018, concluded. The event, held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, brought together nurses and industry and government experts to address the issue of financial toxicity in todayâs cancer care.  
  
ONS President Laura Fennimore, RN, DNP, NEA-BC, implored nurses to stop thinking of financial conversations as a taboo topic and to readily engage upfront with questions to assess affordability concerns. 
 
âOncology nurses play an important role in coordinating care for patients through their cancer journey, including helping to mitigate barriers to quality cancer care,â ONS Chief Strategy Officer Michele McCorkle, MSN, RN, explained. 
 What Nurses Can Do to Help Patients Afford Care  
Typical cancer cost burdens include high deductibles, copays, coinsurance, transportation, parking, gas, childcare, and loss of wages from missed work and function because of cancer side effects (e.g., fatigue, neuropathy), ONS member Darcy Burbage, MSN, RN, AOCN Â® , CBCN Â® , an oncology nurse navigator in Newark, DE, said. She said that nurses need to normalize the conversation to find out if patients have had a change in income or can no longer afford care and should reassure patients that raising financial concerns will not adversely impact their quality of care. Nurses must also educate their patients on cancer treatment affordability and resource availability. 
 
ONS member Mary Anderson, BSN, RN, OCN Â® , an oral oncology nurse navigator in Louisville, KY, advised nurses to help patients organize financial information in a single place to give them a greater sense of control, to respond immediately to calls from specialty pharmacies, and to be their own healthcare advocates. When copays are prohibitive, she said patients may skip doses or not adhere to medications, harming their health outcomes. Some drug companies offer to pay the entire cost of a drug for those meeting poverty criteria, and Anderson recommended financial assistance resources from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Association of Cancer Community Centers, and American Cancer Society. 
   
Nurses face overwhelming administrative burdens as they manage prior authorizations, denials, appeals, medical leave, and long-term disability paperwork, ONS member Bobbie Jo Khan, MS, RN, OCN Â® , an oncology nurse in Washington, DC, said. She encouraged nurses to seek counsel from senior nurses, to engage with social workers on nonclinical aspects of care (e.g., rent, transportation), and to seek out less costly alternative treatments. 
 
Nancy Corbitt, BSN, RN, OCN Â® , CRNI, ONS member and survivorship nurse navigator in Baltimore, MD, said that patients participating in clinical trials need to understand their insurance and patient costs upfront because manufacturers are not allowed to waive copays in trials. She added that survivors may be financially burdened for many years while paying for treatment of long-term effects. 
 Industry Challenges Contribute to Financial Toxicity  
Patient Advocate Foundation Chief Executive Officer Alan Balch, PhD, shared survey data showing that patients with cancer want meaningful financial conversations about treatment costs upfront, but he acknowledged that accurately ascertaining such costs is difficult. He discussed state initiatives of concern that prohibit manufacturer copay assistance cards from accumulating toward a patientâs deductible. 
 
Mike Ybarra, MD, FAAEM, FACEP, vice president of medical affairs for the Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers Association, said the drug industry opposes a newly proposed Medicare Part B drug model based on international drug prices that could reduce provider reimbursement and harm patient access. He was critical of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that do not pass along manufacturer rebates to consumers. 
   What Patients Should Know About Medicare and Insurance Cancer Coverage  
When using private insurance, Georgetown University research professor JoAnn Valk, MA, in Washington, DC, said that patients need to be reminded that they may need to pay out-of-pocket charges for care from out-of-network providers. 
 
Judith Gorsuch, JD, vice president at Hart Health Strategies in Washington, DC, raised concerns that Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may consider future Medicare restrictions on off-label use for some oncology products and on certain cancer drugs currently in protected classes. She pointed out that patients with Medicare or Medicaid are not permitted to use manufacturer copay assistance cards to defray costs. Additionally, she said that a proposed HHS regulation to require drug list prices to be disclosed in TV ads is not likely to help patients because list prices are misleading. 
 
In a post-election analysis, Tim Yehl, principal at Hart Health Strategies, predicted that the healthcare issues that helped elect new Democrats to the U.S. House of Representatives will lead to heightened oversight hearings scrutinizing the Trump administrationâs healthcare and prescription drug cost reform proposals. 
 Connect Patients to the Right Resources  
A summit highlight was hearing Jeannine Walston, a 20-year brain cancer survivor and patient advocate, share her struggles as a young working person and the stress her treatment had on family members. Her resource recommendations for patients, based on her own experience, are in Figures 1 and 2.

    <content type="text">Prescription drug prices are on the rise, and congressional lawmakers are preparing to take on the pharmaceutical industry. 

This past July, President Trump called out prescription drug companies for âplanned increasesâ by saying they were making a âfortuneâ at the expense of American consumers. 

âIn some cases, when medicine cost a few dollars in a foreign country, cost hundreds of dollars in America for the same pill, for the same ingredients, in the same package, made in the same plant and that is unacceptable,â stated the president. 

Soon after his comments, pharmaceutical companies Novartis and Pfizer announced they would not raise the prices on medications for the rest of the year. However, as 2018 winds down, drug prices are once again hiking up. 

Last month, Pfizer announced it plans to raise drug prices on 10-percent of its portfolio beginning next year. 

More than a dozen lawmakers sent letters to five pharmaceutical companies asking why after they benefited from the recent tax cuts, they continued to charge high prices. 

The companies responded by saying they used their tax savings in a variety of ways, from boosting employee compensation to investing in U.S. facilities and even making donations. 

As a new Congress comes to D.C., observers are saying reining in drug prices will be a major focus in 2019. 

Just this week, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democrat Senator Ron Wyden introduced legislation, which would give the government more power to make sure drug companies play by the rules of the medicaid program. 

As drug companies raise prices on their products, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are raising awareness to their actions.</content>

    <content type="text">Actelion Pharmaceuticals US Inc. will pay $360 million to settle U.S. Department of Justice claims that the company illegally funded a foundation and steered Medicare customers to the foundation, leaving taxpayers to pick up much of the cost as it hiked prices for its pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs. 

Arrangements between drug makers and nonprofit foundations, which cover a portion of drug costs, have gained attention over the past couple of years. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), for example, paid nearly $24 million earlier this year to settle a Justice Department case that alleged it had violated the federal False Claims Act by using a foundation as a conduit to cover patient copays for drugs. 

The foundations are not illegal. In fact, they are key to helping patients cover their part of the cost of increasingly expensive drugs. Congress included co-payment requirements in the federal Medicare insurance program, and foundations have assisted with those payments. 

But in some cases, drug makers have made payments to foundations that were designed to coax patients into buying their drugs. In the case of Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, the Justice Department alleged that the company used the nonprofit Caring Voice Coalition to cover the copays of thousands of Medicare patients using the South San Francisco-based company's PAH drugs Tracleer, Ventravis, Veletri and Opsumit. 

Federal law prohibits a drug company from offering or paying â directly or indirectly, â money to induce Medicare patients to buy the company's drugs. That includes, the Justice Department said, payments of patients' copay obligations. 

Actelion regularly received data from the Caring Voice Coalition detailing how much the Richmond, Va., nonprofit had paid out for patients on Actelion's drugs, and the company used that information to decide how much to give to the foundation, the Justice Department said. Actelion then would confirm with the foundation that its contributions were sufficient to cover the copays for its drugs. 

The arrangement encouraged patients to buy Actelion's drugs when the company knew its drug prices could be too high for consumers, the government alleged Thursday. 

The foundation warned Actelion against receiving the information, the Justice Department said. 

What's more, the government said, Actelion steered PAH patients on Medicare from the company's free drug program, essentially pushing them to the government program that would pay a substantial cost of the drugs. 

During the two-year period investigated by the Justice Department, Actelion boosted the price of its main drug for pulmonary arterial hypertension â high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs â by nearly 30 times the rate of overall U.S. inflation, the department said. 

"This settlement, like prior settlements concerning similar misconduct, makes clear that the government will hold accountable companies that pay illegal kickbacks,â said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justiceâs Civil Division.Â âPharmaceutical companies cannot increase drug prices while engaging in conduct designed to defeat mechanisms put in place to check such prices and then expect Medicare to pay for the ballooning costs." 

The Actelion donations occurred in 2014 and 2015, before Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) bought the company in 2017 in a $30 billion deal that netted Actelion's then-CEO Jean-Paul Clozel $1.5 billion. 

Actelion spokesperson Caroline Pavis said in a statement that the company is "committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in our work to help patients get the medicines they need."</content>

    <content type="text">HHS Thursday pushed back against criticism by conservative groups of its proposed demonstration project to link Medicare Part B drug pricing to those of other countries.

Last week, more than 50 advocacy groups slammed the administration's proposed pilot project for an International Pricing Index (IPI), charging that it was akin to price controls and would stifle drug innovation (DID, Nov. 30).

"Medicare isn--t proposing to set prices in Medicare Part B; it already sets prices in Medicare Part B," said John O--Brien, senior advisor to the HHS Secretary for drug pricing reform. "Free market advocates and those who have philosophical concerns about government price-fixing should be among the most vocal opponents of the status quo."

Medicare spent more than $1 billion on one eye drug last year due in large part to the manufacturer charging five times more than the average price in economically similar countries. Medicare comprises more than 70 percent of the drugmaker's business for that product.

Far from imposing international price controls on American drugmakers, the proposal would be a counterweight to such price controls, he said. American firms that don--t agree to foreign countries-- price demands could simply choose not to do business there or negotiate a price better aligned with what Americans pay, he suggested in a blog post.

"The IPI demonstration project only applies to Medicare Part B. In the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, private plans and drug companies negotiate deals that give seniors access to drugs at a cost comparable to those in Europe," O--Brien said. "And even in Medicaid, we get far better deals than seen overseas and some 1,300 drugs are essentially free after rebates." -- Zack Budryk

    <content type="text">Prosecutors allege the Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary used a charity as a funnel to pay Medicare patients' copays for pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs.Â   
Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. will pay $360 million to resolve claims that it illegally paid the copays of thousands of Medicare patients who used the drug maker's hypertension drugs, the Justice Department announced . 
 
Federal prosecutors said the San Francisco-based Actelion used  Caring Voice Coalition , a tax-exempt patient financial assistance charity as an illegal conduit to pay the copays for a number of expensive pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs, including Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri, and Opsumit.Â  
 
The illegal copays induce Medicare patients to buy the drugs that would be otherwise unaffordable. 
 
The Anti-Kickback Statute bans drug makers from payment in any form to induce Medicare patients to purchase the company's drugs. 
 
This week's settlement is the third time in the past year that a drug maker has been caught using charities to skirt anti-kickback laws. 
 
In December, 2017, United Therapeutics Corp. agreed to pay $210 million to resolve claims that it used a foundation to pay the copays of Medicare patients taking UTâs pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs. Pfizer paid $24 million in April  to settle similar allegations. Â  
 
"This settlement, like prior settlements concerning similar misconduct, makes clear that the government will hold accountable companies that pay illegal kickbacks," DOJ Civil Division Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt said in a media release. 
 
"Pharmaceutical companies cannot increase drug prices while engaging in conduct designed to defeat mechanisms put in place to check such prices and then expect Medicare to pay for the ballooning costs," Hunt said. 
 
Actelion spokesperson Caroline Pavis on Thursday issued a brief statement noting that the allegations occurred before the company was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2017, and that the company is "committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in our work to help patients get the medicines they need." 
 
According to DOJ, from 2014 to 2015, Actelion made donations to Caring Voice Coalition, which used the money to pay copays of patients for the drugs. During the time covered in the settlement, prosecutors said Actelion raised the price of Tracleer by nearly 30 times the rate of inflation in the United States.Â  
 
Actelion routinely obtained data from CVC detailing how much it had spent for patients on each drug, and then used the information to decide how much to donate to the foundation and to confirm that its contributions were sufficient to cover the copays of only patients taking Actelion's drugs. 
 
Prosecutors said Actelion also would not allow Medicare patients to participate in its free drug program for financially needy patients, even if the Medicare patients couldn't afford the copays.Â  
 
Instead, Actelion allegedly referred Medicare patients to CVC, which paid the copays, allowing the claims to be paid for by Medicare.Â Â Â  
 
Actelion continued to do this even after CVC warned the company about the impropriety, DOJ said.Â  
 
CVC did not respond to HealthLeaders Media's request for comment Friday morning. However, the charity's website published a notice last January that it would no longer offer financial assistance for drug copays.

 US healthcare spending rises to $3.5 trillion in 2017. That equals out to about $10,739 per person , according to an annual report released Thursday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Healthcare spending growth was 3.9 percent for the year, below the 4.8 percent rate in 2016 and near the slow rates seen in the years just after the financial crisis. Â CMS actuaries attribute the slowdown to people using less healthcare goods and services, including fewer visits to the doctor's office and to hospitals, and to lower spending on prescription drugs. The share of gross domestic product devoted to healthcare spending was 17.9 percent in 2017, similar to the share recorded in 2016. The share was largely unchanged because the economy grew 4.2 percent in 2017, compared to just 2.7 percent a year earlier. During the post-recession years from 2008 to 2013, the rate of growth in healthcare spending averaged 3.8 percent. This amount represented a historic low and was often touted by officials under the Obama administration. Spending accelerated in the two years that immediately followed, however, largely because Obamacare went into effect, and also because spending on drugs reached a record high. During those years, healthcare spending growth averaged of 5.5 percent, outpacing GDP growth. 
 
 Drug spending stays almost flat under Trump. Spending on prescription drugs was nearly flat during President Trump's first year in office , according to the latest report from nonpartisan government actuaries. In 2017, drug spending rose by 0.4 percent to $333.4 billion, the Office of the Actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported Thursday. That was the lowest rate of growth in prescription drug spending since 2012, when it was 0.2 percent. 
 
The slowdown in drug spending had begun in 2016 , during former President Barack Obama's final year, after rapid growth during the two previous years.The reversal represents a large shift from the years that immediately preceded it, when big price increases were the norm. Prescription drug spending grew by 8.9 percent in 2015 and by 12.4 percent in 2014 before slowing to 1.3 percent in 2016. 
 
 Why did the growth in spending on drugs slow? Â  Part of the slowdown in drug spending is attributable to a slower rate of growth in the number of people taking prescriptions. In 2016, prescription uptake grew 2.3 percent, and in 2017, it grew only 1.8 percent. This shift reflects pressure amid the opioid crisis, which claimed the lives of more than 40,000 people in 2017 . More than 2 million people in the U.S. are addicted to prescription opioids, and the government and advocacy groups have been pressuring doctors and hospitals to prescribe less of them. 
 
"The numbers of prescription dispensed for pain had a large impact on the trend," said Anne Martin, lead author of the report who is an economist in the actuary office, referring to lower drug spending. "A lot of that did have to do with the opioid epidemic and greater tightening of those types of prescriptions being dispensed." Also, fewer types of other prescription drugs were given out, more lower-cost generics hit the market, and fewer prescriptions were written for high-cost drugs, including those that cure the liver disease hepatitis C. Fewer hepatitis C drugs were given out in 2017 because the people who took them in the years prior were cured and didn't need the medication anymore.

 Trump administration reaches final decision on risk adjustment program, despite pending litigation. The risk administment program will continue under the same structure that was set in 2018, CMS announced Friday. The roughly $10 billion in risk adjustment payments are intended to reduce incentives for insurers to try to bring in only healthy customers and avoid customers with pre-existing illnesses. Insurers who have healthier customers chip into a fund to alleviate costs for those whose customers need more expensive medical services. The Trump administration announced July 7 that it was putting the program on hold, a move blasted by Democrats as " sabotage " and that worried insurers, who said they would face too much uncertainty in pricing plans. Â But CMS said that it was pausing the payments because of a court ruling in February that found the formula used to calculate the payments was flawed. It lifted the hold a couple of weeks later following criticism, and invited feedback before issuing the final rule Friday. Seema Verma, CMS administrator, said in a statement that the rule âcontinues our commitment to provide certainty regarding this important program, to give insurers the confidence they need to continue participating in the markets, and, ultimately, to guarantee that consumers have access to better coverage options.â 
 
 Maternal mortality bill heads to Trump. Congress has sent the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act to Trumpâs desk. The bill requires the Health Resources and Services Administration to collect better data to place maternity care professionals in areas where there are shortages. Every year, 65,000 women have complications during or after childbirth that require additional medical attention . The data are intended to help shed light on why these complications, and hundreds of deaths, are happening. Many cases are linked to conditions involving bleeding or high blood pressure, and black women have been disproportionately affected. 
 
 Congress quickly passes two-week funding bill to avoid shutdown. The House and Senate on Thursday quickly approved a two-week extension of funding for the federal government in order to avoid a partial government shutdown that otherwise would happen on Saturday. The measure extends 2018 spending levels for seven appropriations bills that fund about 25 percent of the federal government while lawmakers work out a deal for 2019 levels. The remainder of fiscal 2019 government funding, including the Defense Department, was signed into law earlier this year. The House passed by resolution by voice vote around noon Thursday, and the Senate quickly approved it in the same manner less than an hour later. The two-week measure provides more time for Democrats, Republicans, and the president to find an accord on border wall funding. Both parties agreed to the short extension in light of the death of President George H.W. Bush, which forced Congress to pause its work this week. 
 
 Employee share of health plan costs rose nearly 2 percentage points in about a decade. In 2008, the share employees contributed to their health insurance premiums was 5.1 percent, and by 2017 that percentage rose to 6.9 percent, according to a study by the Commonwealth Fund . This share rose faster than median income, and employees also took on more in deductibles over that period, rising to an average of $1,808 for an individual plan. Employer-sponsored health plans cover 152 million people, or roughly half the U.S. population. The study was conducted through surveys of 40,000 businesses in 2017, 65.8 percent of whom responded. Â  
 
 CDC: 58 million exposed to secondhand smoke. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that progress has stalled in reducing exposure to secondhand smoke, even though progress has been made over the long-term. In 1988, 87 percent of the population was exposed to tobacco smoke, and by 2014 that number fell to 25 percent of people. The report urged states to implement smoke-free laws in public areas and in workplaces. 
 
 20 Democratic senators urge FDA to pull flavored e-cigarettes from the market. The FDA must take flavored e-cigarettes off the market to combat its use in young people, 20 Democratic said in a letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb . They also urged the FDA to ban flavored cigars and menthol cigarettes, and end the marketing of tobacco to young people. âIt is well past time to end the marketing of products that so clearly impact the health of our youth, and we urge the agency to act quickly to make good on its commitment to take them off the market once and for all,â wrote the senators, led by Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Ed Markey, D-Mass. 
 
 CDC: Tainted romaine lettuce has sickened 52 people over two months. The CDC on Thursday identified nine more people who have become sick as a result of E. coli poisoning from romaine lettuce. A total of 52 people from 15 states have been diagnosed with infections as a result of eating the tainted lettuce since the outbreak started two months ago, according to the government agency. Nineteen of the 52 victims have been hospitalized. Two of those people developed a type of kidney failure. The CDC has not reported any related deaths. 
 
 HHS to team up with NASA for healthy outer-space travel. HHS is working with NASA on research that would benefit people on earth and those who travel to the moon and other areas in outer space, the agency announced Thursday. The contract goes beyond what NASA arranged with the National Institutes of Health, involving agencies such as the FDA and the CDC. It will help identify and deal with health risks people might face when theyâre traveling in space, including heartbeat problems, nutrition, mental health issues, and infectious facing diseases that arenât known.

    <content type="text">WASHINGTON , Dec. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --Â  Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) President and CEO JC Scott released the following statement on new National Health Expenditure (NHE) data from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services: 

"The latest National Healthcare Expenditure data from CMS offers yet another proof point that PBMs are doing our job, reducing prescription drug costs and increasing access to needed treatments for consumers and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. By negotiating with drugmakers and drugstores, and promoting lower-cost generics and more affordable treatment options, PBMs continue to be part of the solution to lowering health care costs. 

Growth in retail prescription drug spending slowed in 2017, increasing just 0.4 percent to $333.4 billion , according to the NHE data . The same data show that patient out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs increased only 0.1%. In the report, CMS cites a shift to lower-cost generic drugs, and lower use of high-cost brand drugs as reasons for the decreased spending. The key to further reducing prescription drug costs is increased competition." 



PCMA is the national association representing America's pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). PBMs administer prescription drug plans for more than 266 million Americans who have health insurance from a variety of sponsors including: commercial health plans, self-insured employer plans, union plans, Medicare Part D plans, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), state government employee plans, Medicaid plans, and others.

    <content type="text">This week, the Initiative for Medicines, Access &amp; Knowledge (I-MAK) released its latest edition of a report series titled âOverpatented, Overpriced.â The report demonstrates the fact that drug makers have filed hundreds of patent applications on the top 12 best-selling drugs in the United States in order to attain patent protection for an average of 38 years. The most recent report focuses on etanercept (Enbrel), which is indicated to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and moderate-to-severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis. 
The report found that Amgen, the developer of Enbrel, filed 72% of its total patent applications for the product after it had already received FDA approval. The primary patent on the reference product was filed in 1990 and expired in 2010. However, the report notes that, to date, there are at least 19 patent active patent applications and granted patents that protect the commercial exclusivity of the product until the last expires in 2029. 

Additionally, the report found that Amgen filed nearly 3 times more patent applications in the United States than it did in either Europe or Japan. Specifically, in the United States, Amgen has 57 patents on Enbrel, whereas in Europe it has 20, and in Japan it has 18. 

In fact, in Europe, the first biosimilar version of etanercept was launched in spring of 2016, and since then, âprices have dropped by nearly half and biosimilars have a 40% market share.â 

Conversely, there have been no launches of biosimilar versions of etanercept in the United States due to ongoing patent litigation, though a biosimilar product, Erelzi , has been FDA-approved since 2016 (Erelzi is already launched in Canada). 

The report goes on to discuss the impact that extensive patenting has on taxpayers, specifically through Medicare and Medicaid purchases. âBetween 2012 and 2016, total Medicare and Medicaid spending on Enbrel increased 129% and a total of $7.7 billion of taxpayer funds were spent on the drug. During that time the average annual Medicare spending on Enbrel per person (the annual price of the drug) nearly doubled from $16,828 to $32,891,â says the report. 

While drug pricing has taken center stage in American politics as of late, drug patenting remains minimally discussed. I-MAK stresses that âUntil the US government starts to substantively address the overpatenting of medicines, American consumers and payers will continue to bear the side effects. The US cannot fix the drug pricing crisis until it solves the drug patent problem.â 

The report goes a step further, and suggests specific policy changes that could address the problem, including the following: 
 Modifying the âinventiveness" standard for issuing patents  Eliminating continuation applications at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) so that an applicant does not have unlimited attempts to obtain a patent on the same invention  Maintaining and improving the existing patent challenge system, including inter partes review (IPR) proceedings  Creating a pre-grant opposition system similar to the one USPTO uses for trademarks  Allowing the removal of a patent from the FDAâs Orange Book if it is invalidated using the post-grant review or IPR processes, and improving quality and transparency of the Orange Book</content>

    <content type="text">Two articles in the New York Times health section today reinforce a major message from a recent Annals On Call: Oral Pharmacologic Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes: Choosing Therapy Wisely (Podcast with Dr. Mike Barry)âprice matters. 
The first article, â Amgen Slashes the Price of a Promising Cholesterol Drug â refers to their PCSK9 inhibitor. 
 
For years, the drug maker Amgen has struggled to sell its new anti-cholesterol drug, Repatha after insurers balked over the list price of about $14,000 a year. 
On Wednesday, Amgen took a new approach: It said it would slash the list price to $5,850 a year in hopes of increasing sales, especially among Medicare beneficiaries who are particularly vulnerable to a drug's list price. 
 
Yesterday President Trump proposed an interesting strategy to decrease the prices that Medicare pays to pharmaceutical companies, in the article â Trump Proposes to Lower Drug Prices by Basing Them on Other Countries' Costs â.  
Mr. Trump's announcement came a few hours after his administration released a government study that said Medicare was paying 80% more than other advanced industrial countries for some of the most costly physician-administered medicines. 
âThe current international drug-pricing system has put America in last place,â Alex M. Azar II, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said in unveiling the report. 
Mr. Trump cited the government's international drug-pricing report in his speech on Thursday, saying he was taking aim at âglobal free ridingâ that forces Americans to subsidize drug prices in other countries. 
âAmericans pay more so that other countries can pay less,â Mr. Trump said. 
The report compares prices charged by drug manufacturers in the United States and 16 other countries for 27 drugs that are covered by Part B of Medicare. 
  
The proposed plan:  
President Trump proposed on Thursday that Medicare pay for certain prescription drugs based on the prices paid in other advanced industrial countries, a huge change that could save money for the government and for millions of Medicare beneficiaries. 
As part of a demonstration project covering half the country, Medicare would establish an âinternational pricing indexâ and use it as a benchmark in deciding how much to pay for drugs covered by Part B of Medicare. 
  
While we have to see more details, the concept seems admirable. Why should we pay more for the same drugs than countries like Germany, England, France, etc.? 
Previous proposals have suggested allowing Medicare to negotiate prices. This idea has not gathered enough support previously. The international pricing index idea at face value sounds promising. Of course, we have to await more details. 

But the big point is that price matters. In economic terms, recent expensive drugs have demonstrated elasticity. Elasticity means that as prices increase the volume of sales decreases. 

We want progress in drug development. We have many exciting new therapeutic approaches. But price does matter. Perhaps Trump's proposal we garner enough data to make pricing more fair for our country. One can only hope. 

db is the nickname for Robert M. Centor, MD, MACP. db stands both for Dr. Bob and da boss. He is an academic general internist at the University of Alabama School of Medicine, and the former Regional Dean for the Huntsville Regional Medical Campus of UASOM. He still makes inpatient rounds regularly at the Birmingham VA and Huntsville Hospital. His current titles are Professor-Emeritus and Chair-Emeritus of the ACP Board of Regents.

December 07, 2018 -Â Last year, healthcare spending in the US jumped at an estimated rate of 3.9 percent to $3.5 trillion â or $10,739 per person, according to a new analysis from the Office of the Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services in Health Affairs . 
 
After expanded insurance coverage and increased spending on prescription drugs contributed to elevated rates of growth in 2014 and 2015, growth slowed for the second straight year on the heels of a climb of 4.8 percent in 2016 and 5.8 percent in 2015. The low rate of spending growth in 2017 resembled the average annual rate of 3.9 percent between 2008 and 2013, predating major coverage expansion. 
 
In 2017, growth in GDP accelerated, rising 4.2 percent from 2.7 percent the prior year. Healthcare spending, meantime, spiked 3.9 percent. As a result, the share of the economy devoted to healthcare in 2017 stabilized at 17.9 percent, compared to 18 percent rate in 2016 â the first time since 2013 there was no increase in the share. 
  Dig Deeper  
Last year saw slower growth in total healthcare spending. It was prompted primarily by similarly shored spending growth in hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs, with residual use and intensity of these services substantially contributing to the trend. Whatâs more, in 2017, the growth in spending for private health insurance and Medicaid slowed, and remained relatively flat for Medicare. 
 
National health spending grew 3.2 percent on a per capita basis last year, compared to four percent in 2016. A descent in the residual use and intensity of goods and services; particularly in hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs, primarily fueled the overall slowdown, escalating 1.1 percent in 2017, down from 2.1 percent the year before. However, medical price growth slightly up ticked, from 1.3 percent in 2016 to 1.6 percent last year. 
 
âPrior to the coverage expansions and temporary high growth in prescription drug spending during that same period, health spending was growing at historically low rates,â said lead author Anne Martin, an economist in the Office of the Actuary. âIn 2017, health care spending growth returned to these lower rates and the health spending share of GDP stabilized for the first time since 2013.â 
 
Meantime, the new analysis showed major payersâ spending growth in 2017 included: 
 
Private health insurance (4.2 percent) â Reached $1.2 trillion in 2017, slower than 2016 when growth was 6.2 percent. The 2017 figure accounted for 34 percent of total national health spending. Influencing the slowdown, in part, was slower growth in medical benefits and a decline in fees and taxes, which stemmed from the suspended collection of the health insurance plan fee in 2017. 
 
Medicare spending (4.2 percent) â Reached $705.9 billion in 2017 and accounted for 20 percent of total health care expenditures. In 2017, spending growth spiked 1.7 percent, compared to a growth rate of 1.6 percent the previous year per Medicare enrollee. 
 
Medicare fee-for-service spending accounted for two-thirds of overall Medicare spending in 2017 and increased 1.4 percent. That represents a 2.6 percent growth slowdown in 2016. Meantime, spending for Medicare private health plans â comprising the remaining one-third of total Medicare spending â rose 10 percent in 2017. The previous year, it grew 8.1 percent. 
 
Medicaid expenditures (2.9 percent) â Reached $581.9 billion in 2017, accounting for 17 percent of total national health expenditures. Spending growth slowed for the third straight year. It was 4.2 percent in 2016. 
 
Not surprisingly, wealthy countries like the US tend to spend more per person on healthcare and related expenses than less prosperous nations, according to the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker . However, the US spends more per person on health than comparable countries. Health spending per person in the US. was $10,348 in 2016 â 31 percent higher than Switzerland, the next highest per capita spender. 
 
According to a recent analysis published in JAMA , healthcare accounts for almost 18% of the US GDP, compared to 9.6% to 12.4% in the other developed countries. Healthcare spending in the US is roughly twice that of other high-income nations â but all that extra money isnât leading to better health. 
 
A group of researchers compared data from the U.S. and 10 other high-income countries: The United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Denmark. They found that spending in the US far outpaces that of other nations. 
 
Contrary to popular belief, the researchers didnât find that people in the US use the medical system significantly more often than those in other countries â nor did they find that the way Americans use the medical system accounts for the disconnect in spending. Underinvestment in social services didnât appear to explain the difference, either. Instead, high prices for labor and goods â including drugs, procedures and administrative services â are likely the major reasons.</content>

    <content type="text">As an executive at an agency aiming to improve the lives of more than 100 million people worldwide, Soma Stout would seem to have a tough job ahead of her. 

But reaching that goal within two years isn't a matter of working harder, Stout said Friday at the Central Massachusetts Health Care Forum. 

"We don't have to work harder," she said. "We just have to work in closer partnership." 

Stout, the keynote speaker at the forum, said that much of improving health care can be accomplished through the relatively simple change of health care providers working more closely with community agencies who may know patients the best. 

"Drop a chair at the table and say, what can we do to help with our resources?" she said. 

The forum, held at the Beechwood Hotel and organized by the Worcester Business Journal, also included a panel that discussed the state's high medical costs for patients and skyrocketing costs for prescription drugs. 

The state has taken action to try cutting down medical costs, including forming the Health Policy Commission in 2012 as an independent agency to monitor health care spending. The commission's executive director, David Seltz, said the good news is that Massachusetts is no longer highest in the country for costs. 

Now in second place behind only Alaska, Massachusetts still has far more work to do, Seltz said. Still, the state's most recent annual cost increase of less than 2 percent is promising, he said. 

"That is a success story for this commonwealth," Seltz said. 

Other cost challenges need attention too, panelists said. 

One lingering problem in trying to keep costs down is that hospitals don't have the financial incentives to keep patients out of their facilities, said Michael Sheehy, the chief of population health and analytics at Reliant Medical Group. That puts hospitals at odds with other providers looking to initiate more preventative care, he said. 

"Business models drive behavior," Sheehy said. "It's going to take a lot more work to get there." 

Seltz agreed, and said the state is still only slowly moving away from a fee-for-service model in how providers are paid for their services. The new MassHealth program for Medicaid patients, in which providers and insurers team in accountable care organizations, is now changing that system. 

"We're still in a bifurcated world," Seltz said, referring to the fee-for-service model that still exists in places. 

The panel, which was moderated by Fallon Health Chief Medical Officer Carolyn Langer, also addressed high prescription drug costs and the increasing use of data in health care. 

"The baseline of everything we do is data," said John Greenwood, the president of UMass Memorial Health Care's accountable care organization. 

Last year, UMass spent $650 million for a new electronic patient records system called Epic. With more data on patients, the hospital network can help doctors and nurses have more information to provide better care, Greenwood said. 

As for drug costs, the panelists said high costs remain a difficult challenge. 

"It's been the number-one driver in terms of health care spending," Seltz said. Those costs are harder to curb because costs are set nationally, he said, and based on what the market can bear and what can maximize profits for drugmakers, not on what's best for patients. 

Annual drug price increases in recent years have averaged around 8 percent or 9 percent, Sheehy said. 

"Not long ago a $30,000 to $50,000 drug was considered a high-cost drug. But now you have to add a zero on that. It's gone up by an order of magnitude," he said. "Insulin prices have doubled in 10 years. This is, I think, the single biggest driver that we have to wrestle with."</content>

    <content type="text">Hospital CFOs continue to be challenged by the financial metric of net revenue per case, which fluctuates by payer type, according to a report from Crowe , a public accounting, consulting and technology firm. 
 
Using data from its revenue cycle analytics software, Crowe examined patient financial transactions in 622 hospitals within Medicaid expansion states and 389 hospitals in nonexpansion states this year. 
 
When comparing January through September of 2017 to the same period this year, the report found inpatient care volume climbed 0.6 percent overall among the studied hospitals. Outpatient care volume rose 2.4 percent. Crowe said net revenue per case also increased 1.6 percent year over year for inpatient care and 5.5 percent for outpatient care. 
 
Although there were increases in national inpatient and outpatient volume, as well as net revenue per case, data showed net revenue per case was more unstable when broken down by payer class, said Brian Sanderson, managing principal ofÂ CroweÂ healthcare services. Crowe found that year over year: 
  Medicare-paid net revenue per case climbed 4.1 percent.  Commercial managed care-paid net revenue per case increased 3.8 percent.  Medicaid-paid net revenue per case decreased 6.9 percent for inpatient and decreased 1.1 percent for outpatient. Overall, Medicaid-paid net revenue per case decreased 3.8 percent. "Regulatory changes (for example, changes to disproportionate share hospital payments and 340B Drug Pricing Program benefits) tied to the Medicaid population also will compromise hospitals that treat a greater percentage of Medicaid recipients," Crowe noted.  Self-paid net revenue per case increased 14.4 percent. Crowe said the increase could be associated with revenue cycle collection improvements at hospitals.  The net revenue per case of "other" payers (third-party liability, workers' compensation and other nontraditional pay groups) climbed 14.8 percent.   
"As many health systems expand their portfolio of services to include more outpatient facilities, insurance products and other ancillary investments, stability of hospital-based net revenue becomes more important to financial decisions," said Mr. Sanderson. "Unfortunately, instability appears to be the current trend, forcing many CFOs of nonprofit healthcare systems to study operations and budget them on a monthly or quarterly financial performance basis, in the same manner that their peers in for-profit organizations do."</content>

âRetail prescription drug spending growth slowed in 2017 primarily due to slower growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed, a continued shift to lower-cost generic drugs, slower growth in the volume of some high-cost drugs, declines in generic drug prices, and lower price increases for existing brand-name drugs,â according to the Office of the Actuary.

    <content type="text">Actelion Pharmaceuticals US Inc. has agreed to pay $360 million for allegedly payingÂ kickbacks to medicare patients through a purportedly independent charitable foundation. 

âUsing data from a foundation that it knew it should not have, Actelion effectively set up a proprietary fund to cover the copays of just its own drugs,â United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in a statement. âSuch conduct not only violates the anti-kickback statute, it also undermines the Medicare programâs co-pay structure, which Congress created as a safeguard against inflated drug prices. During the period covered by todayâs settlement, Actelion raised the price of its main PAH drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of overall inflation in the United States.â 

When a Medicare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug covered by Medicare Part B or Part D, the beneficiary may be required to make a partial payment, which may take the form of a copayment, coinsurance or deductible. 

These copay obligations may be substantial for expensive medications. Congress included co-pay requirements in these programs, in part, to encourage market forces to serve as a check on health care costs, including the prices that pharmaceutical manufacturers can demand for their drugs. 

The government alleged that Actelion,Â a seller of hypertension drugs called PAH drugs, used data from a foundation as a conduit to pay the copay obligations of thousands of medicare patients taking Actelionâs PAH drugs. 

By doing so, the government alleged, Actelion was able to induce patients to purchase its drugs when the prices Actelion had set for those drugs otherwise could have posed a barrier to purchases. 

The anti-kickback statute prohibits pharmaceutical companies from offering or paying, directly or indirectly, any remuneration â which includes money or any other thing of value â to induce medicare patients to purchase the companiesâ drugs. 

The government also alleged that Actelion had a policy of not permitting Medicare patients to participate in its free drug program, which was open to other financially needy patients, even if those Medicare patients could not afford their copays for Actelionâs drugs. 

Instead, to generate revenue from Medicare and induce purchases of its drugs, the government alleged that Actelion referred such Medicare patients to the foundation, which allowed the patientsâ copays to be paid and resulted in claims to medicare for the remaining cost. 

Johnson &amp; Johnson acquired Actelion in June 2017. Johnson &amp; Johnson was not involved, directly or indirectly, in the alleged conduct and the allegations above do not relate in any way to Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Federal prosecutors announced Thursday that Actelion Pharmaceuticals has agreed to a $360 million settlement stemming from an investigation into whether the company illegally funneled kickbacks through a patient-assistance charity. Actelion, which was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2017, manufactures expensive drugs to treat a rare lung condition. It is the latest pharmaceutical company to settle federal inquiries into its ties to patient-assistance groups. "Pharmaceutical companies cannot have it both waysâthey cannot continue to increase drug prices while engaging in conduct designed to defeat the mechanisms that Congress designed to check such prices and then expect Medicare to pay for the ballooning costs," said Joseph Hunt, an assistant attorney general for the Justice Department. In 2014 and 2015, prosecutors said, Actelion raised the price of its main drug, bosentan (Tracleer), by nearly 30 times the rate of inflation. Actelion admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement. Johnson &amp; Johnson was not implicated in the allegations since the activity under scrutiny took place before Actelion was acquired.</content>

Transcript: 

Would disclosing drugs' list prices in ads help drive down prices for patients? 

To be honest, I donât think disclosing list prices is really going to have the difference that we need to see in the current marketplace, in the current crisis that weâre facing regarding drug pricing. 

I think itâs useful to have the list pricing there, but will that really change essentially where the abuse is really happening? We believe it has to lie in changing the patent system, in changing how we hand out 20-year monopoly periods to companies. Until you do that, you really arenât going to see marked changes, and companies will find other ways to strategically cover up the list pricing in other ways. 

I donât think thatâs a measure that really helps. I think thatâs really a deflection, if anything, [rather than] going to the source of the problem.

    <content type="text">Congress and the Trump administration are riled up about pharma prices and promising to drive them down, but a new U.S. government report shows growth in retail drug spending screeched to a halt in 2017.

The data, released by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Thursday, show growth in spending on pharmacy-dispensed drugs slowed to 0.4% last year, down sharply from 2.3% in 2016âand even more sharply from the increases in 2015 and 2014, CMS reported. Drug costs for those years grew 8.9% and 12.4%, respectively.

Why the slowdown? For one thing, drugmakers pushed through lower price hikes, CMS said. Prescription growth also slowed, while more patients started on generics and generic prices dropped, the agency said. The new CMS data hit as drug prices continue to occupy center stage in Washington. After years of scrutiny on pharmaâs pricing practicesâand annual increases in prices and costsâCongress and the Trump administration have made the issue a priority. The FDA is approving generics at a record pace and prioritizing applications for drugs with little to no competition. The administration is working to force drugmakers to include prices in TV ads and lower certain U.S. prices closer to international levels, among a slew of other proposals.

Meanwhile, uncomfortable in the spotlight, many drugmakers have pumped the brakes on price hikes. Pfizer, for instance, raised prices this summer but backpedaledâat least temporarilyâafter the president slammed the company on Twitter. Trump tweeted that Pfizer "should be ashamed" about the move, and the company decided to defer price hikes. It now appears ready to raise them again in early 2019. During the Pfizer controversy, other large drugmakers such as Novartis and Roche said they wouldnât raise prices again in 2</content>

    <content type="text">Democrats and Republicans alike are lining up to criticize pharmaceutical companies for gouging customers and stranding sick patients. 
 
President Donald Trump tweeted that drug companies "should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason." Senator Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who disagrees with the President on virtually everything else, is leading a charge to clamp down on drug prices, which he claims are the "#1 driver for increases in premiums" for health insurance. 
 
These concerns are justified, but the blame is misplaced. Many patients do face high prices at the pharmacy, but that's not because of drug company predation. The problem: the middlemen sitting between manufacturers and patients. 
 
Pharmaceutical companies regularly negotiate substantial discounts with insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and other supply chain players. These discounts shave down the price of the average brand-name drug by about a third. 
 
Discounts have kept drug prices in check. Last year, the average cost of brand-name pharmaceuticals increased just 2 percent  a percent increase well below that of doctor's visits, hospital stays, and other parts of the healthcare sector. 
 
Generic drugs have also curbed costs. Generics are cheaper than the brand-name drugs they're copied from. Over the last decade, generic drugs have reduced patient health care costs by an estimated $1.67 trillion. 
 
By preventing disease, patients don't develop conditions requiring more invasive, expensive treatments down the road. Every dollar spent on drugs could save up to $10 in avoided ER visits and hospitalizations for patients with congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, diabetes, and more. 
 
But then, the mystery: Given the heavy discounts on brand name products and the prevalence of low-cost generics, why do many patients still face high prices when they fill their prescriptions? 
 
Because health insurers and other middlemen have steadily ratcheted up their cost-sharing requirements. The product price holds steady, but patients bare an increasingly large slice of the cost. Since 2006, insurance deductibles have increased by 350 percent and co-insurance has jumped 89 percent. 
 
Instead of passing discounts to patients, insurers pocket them. More than half of the out-of-pocket requirements for brand-name drugs in commercial health insurance are based on the full list price of the drug. 
 
In other words, insurers act as if those discounts don't exist. 
 
This abuse fuels an odd phenomenon: for some patients, buying a drug with insurance costs more than paying for it directly out-of-pocket. Roughly 40 percent of brand-name drugs are more expensive if patients use insurance. 
 
The New York Times recently profiled a UnitedHealthcare customer who went to fill his prescription for a generic cholesterol drug. He was told he owed $84. That patient later searched online and found the same drug for just $45. 
 
This mismatch happens all the time. 
 
Voters and their elected officials have ample reason to be angry about sky-high drug prices, but pointing fingers at drug manufacturers isn't helpful. Drug manufacturers have kept prices in check with substantial discounts and low-cost generics.

    <content type="text">HFMA RESOURCE LIBRARY   6 Patient Revenue Cycle Metrics You Should Be Tracking (and How to Improve Your Results)  
Patient financial engagement is more challenging than ever â and more critical. With patient responsibility as a percentage of revenue on the rise, providers have seen their billing-related costs and accounts receivable levels increase. If increasing collection yield and reducing costs are a priority for your organization, the metrics outlined in this presentation will provide the framework you need to understand whatâs working and whatâs not, in order to guide your overall patient financial engagement initiatives and optimize results. 
   10 Ways to Reduce Patient Statement Volume (and Reduce Costs)  
No two patients are the same. Each has a very personal healthcare experience, and each has distinct financial needs and preferences that have an impact on how, when and if they chose to pay their healthcare bill. Itâs no longer effective to apply static billing techniques to solve the complex challenge of collecting balances from patients. The need to tailor financial conversations and payment options to individual needs and preferences is critical. This presentation provides 10 recommendations that will not only help you improve payment performance through a more tailored approach, but take control of rising collection costs. 
   Reduce Patient Balances Sent to Collection Agencies: Approaching New Problems with New Approaches  
This white paper, written by Apex Vice President of Solutions and Services, Carrie Romandine, discusses the importance of patient segmentation and messaging specifically related to the patient revenue cycle. Applying strategic messaging that is tailored to each patient type will not only better educate consumers on payment options specific to their billing needs, but it will maximize the amount collected before sending to collections. Further, targeted messaging should be applied across all points of patient interaction (i.e. point of service, customer service, patient statements) and analyzed regularly for maximized results. 
   The Future of Online Patient Billing Portals  
This white paper, written by Apex President Patrick Maurer, discusses methods to increase patient adoption of online payments. Providers are now seeking ways to incrementally collect more payments due from patients as well as speeding up the rate of collections. This white paper shows why patient-centric approaches to online payment portals are important complements to traditional provider-centric approaches. 
   Payment Portals Can Improve Self-Pay Collections and Support Meaningful Use  
Increased electronic engagement between healthcare providers and patients provides significant opportunities for improving revenue cycle metrics and encouraging patients to access EHRs. This article, written by Apex Founder and CEO Brian Kueppers, explores a number of strategies to create synergy between patient billing, online payment portals and electronic health record (EHR) software to realize a high ROI in speed to payment, patient satisfaction and portal adoption for meaningful use. 
   Large Health System Drives 10% UP (Patient Payments) and 10% DOWN (Billing-related Costs)  
Faced with a rising tide of bad debt, a large Southeastern healthcare system was seeing a sharp decline in net patient revenues. The need to improve collections was dire. By integrating critical tools and processes, the health system was able to increase online payments and improve its financial position. Taking a holistic approach increased overall collection yield by 10% while costs came down because the number of statements sent to patients fell by 10%, which equated to a $1.3M annualized improvement in patient cash over a six-month period. This case study explains how. 
   ICD-10: Managing Performance  
With the ICD10 deadline quickly approaching and daily responsibilities not slowing down, final preparations for October 1 require strategic prioritization and laser focus. 
   Clarity Drives Collections  
Read how Gwinnett Medical Center provides clear connections to financial information, offers multiple payment options for patients, and gives onsite staff the ability to collect payments at multiple points throughout the care process. 
   Revenue Cycle Payment Clarity  
To maintain fiscal fitness and boost patient satisfaction and loyalty, healthcare providers need visibility into when and how much they will be paidâby whomâand the ability to better navigate obstacles to payment. They need payment clarity. This whitepaper illuminates this concept that is winning fans at forward-thinking hospitals. 
   Streamlining the Patient Billing Process  
Financial services staff are always looking for ways to improve the verification, billing and collections processes, and Munson Healthcare is no different. Read about how they streamlined the billing process to produce cleaner bills on the front end and helped financial services staff collect more than $1 million in additional upfront annual revenue in one year. 
   Wallace Thomson Hospital Automates to Maximize Limited Resources  
Effective revenue cycle management can be a challenge for any hospital, but for smaller providers it is even tougher. Read how Wallace Thomson identified unreimbursed procedures, streamlined claims management, and improved its ability to determine charity eligibility. 
   7 Steps for Building and Funding Sustainability Projects  
Before launching an energy-efficiency initiative, itâs important to build a solid business case and understand the funding options and potential incentives that are available. Healthcare leaders should consider taking the steps outlined in the whitepaper to ease the process of gaining approval, piloting, implementing, and supporting sustainability projects.  You will find that investing in sustainability and energy efficiency helps hospitals add cash to their bottom line. Discover how hospitals and health systems have various options for funding energy-efficient and renewable-energy initiatives, depending on their current financial structure and strategy. 
   Key Capital Considerations for Mergers and Acquisitions  
Health care is a dynamic mergers and acquisitions market with numerous hospitals and health systems contemplating or pursuing formal arrangements with other entities. These relationships often pose a strategic benefit, such as enhancing competencies across the continuum, facilitating economies of scale, or giving the participants a competitive advantage in a crowded market. Underpinning any profitable acquisition is a robust capital planning strategy that ensures an organization reserves sufficient funds and efficiently onboards partners that advance the enterprise mission and values. 
   Key Capital Considerations for Mergers and Acquisitions  
The success of healthcare mergers, acquisitions, and other affiliations is predicated in part on available capital, and the need for and sources of funding are considerations present throughout the partnering process, from choosing a partner to evaluating an arrangementâs capital needs to selecting an integration model to finding the right money source to finance the deal. This whitepaper offers several strategies that health system leaders have used to assess and manage capital needs for their growing networks. 
   Trend Watch: Providers adapt as value-based care moves from hype to reality  
Announcements from several commercial payers and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) early in 2015 around increased efforts to form value-based contracts with providers seemed to point to an impending rise in risk-based contracting. Rather than wait for disruption from the outside in, health care providers are now making inroads on collaborating with payers on various risk-based contracting models to increase the value of health care from within. 
   Yuma Regional Medical Center case study  
Yuma Regional Medical Center (YRMC) is a not-for-profit hospital serving a population of roughly 200,000 in Yuma and the surrounding communities.
Before becoming a ZirMed client, Yuma was attempting to manually monitor hundreds of thousands of charges which led to significant charge capture leakage. Learn how Yuma &amp; ZirMed worked together to address underlying collections issues at the front end, thus increasing Yumaâs overall bottom line. 
   Reforming with a New 50-Bed Acute Care Facility  
Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services works with partners to audit the market and the facilityâs role in that market to identify opportunities for improvement. This approach leads to successes; Kindredâs clinical rehab and management expertise complements our partnersâ strengths. Every facility and challenge is unique, and requires a full objective analysis. 
   5-Minute Briefing on Reducing the Cost of RCM WhitePaper Hospitals FS  
Qualified coders are getting harder to come by, and even the most seasoned professional can struggle with the complexity of ICD-10. This 5-Minute White Paper Briefing explains how partnerships can help improve coding and other key RCM operations potentially at a cost savings. 
   Providers Focus Too Much On Revenue Cycle Management  
The point of managing your revenue cycle isnât just to improve revenue and cash flow. Itâs to do those things effectively by consistently following best practicesâ while spending as little time, money, and energy on them as possible. 
   Using Predictive Modeling To Detect Meaningful Correlations Across Claims Denials Data  
The reasons claims are denied are so varied that managing denials can feel like chasing a thousand different tails. This situation is not surprising given that a hypothetical denial rate of just 5 percent translates to tens of thousands of denied claims per year for large hospitalsâwhere realâworld denial rates often range from 12 to 22 percent. Read about how predictive modeling can detect meaningful correlations across claims denials data. 
   ZOLL and Emergency Mobile Health Care Case Study  
Emergency Mobile Health Care (EMHC) was founded to be and remains an exclusively locally owned and operated emergency medical service organization; today EMHC serves a population of more than a million people in and around Memphis, answering 75,000 calls each year. 
   Maximizing Medicare Reimbursements White Paper  
Since the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) introduction, CMS has paid more than $100 million in bonus payments to participants. However, these bonuses ended in 2015; providers who successfully meet the reporting requirements in 2016 will avoid the 2% negative payment adjustment in 2018, so now is the time to act! Included in this whitepaper are implications of increasing patient responsibility, collections best practices, and collections and internal control solutions. 
   Denials Deconstructed: Getting Your Claims Paid  
Getting paid what your physician deservesâthatâs the goal of every biller. Yet even for the best billers, achieving that success can be elusive when denials stand in the way of success, presenting challenges at every turn. Denials arenât going away, but you can learn techniques to manage and even prevent them.Join practice management expert Elizabeth W. Woodcock, MBA, FACMPE, CPC, to: Discover methods to translate denial data into business intelligence to improve your bottom line, determine staff productivity benchmarks for billers, and recognize common mistakes in denial management. 
   Winning in the Post-Acute Marketplace  
Read more about factors contributing to the changes in the post-acute marketplace and what it means for manufacturers, physicians, clinicians, patients, and post-acute facilities as they anticipate the transition to the second curve. 
   Building A Common Vision with Employed Physicians  
HSG helped the physicians and executives of St. Claire Regional in Morehead, Kentucky, define their shared vision for how the group would evolve over the next decade. As well as, develop the strategic and operational priorities which refocused and accelerated the groupâs evolution. 
   Practice Performance Improvement  
The client was a nine-hospital health system with 14 clinics serving communities in a multi-state market with very limited access to care, poor economic conditions, high unemployment, and a heavy Medicare/Medicaid/uninsured payer mix. In most of these communities, the system was the sole source of care. 
Though the clinics were of substantial size (they employed 98 physicians) and comprised of multiple specialists, the physicians functioned as individuals and the practices lacked any real group culture. 
   Clinical Integration Without Spending a Fortune  
Clinical integration can be expensive, but it doesnât have to be, as this four-step road map for developing a CIN proves. Does it have to cost millions to initiate a clinical integration strategy? 
Contrary to popular belief, we have clients who have generated substantial shared savings and a significant ROI over time, without massive investments.  Yes, some financial capital is required for resources the CIN providers canât bring to the table themselves. But the size of that investment can be miniscule relative to the value it produces: improved outcomes and documentation for payers. 
   Adding Value to Physician Compensation  
Todayâs concerns about physician compensation are the result of the changing healthcare environment. The transition to value is slow, but finally becoming a reality. Proactive hospitals want to ensure that provider incentives are properly aligned with ever-increasing value-based demands. 
This report focuses on the three big questions HSG receives about adding value to physician compensation; Why are organizations redesigning their provider compensation plans? What elements and parameters must be part of successful compensation plans? How are organizations implementing compensation changes? 
   Effective Revenue Cycle Management in Your Network  
Revenue Cycle Management has become an even more complex issue with declining reimbursements, implementation of Electronic Health Records, evolving local carrier determinations (LCD), and payer credentialing [The emphasis on healthcare fraud, abuse and compliance has increased the importance of accuracy of data reporting and claims filing).
The efficiency of a medical practiceâs billing operations has critical impact on the financial performance.  In many cases, patient billings are the primary revenue source that pays staff salaries, provider compensation and overhead operating cost.  Inefficiencies or inaccurate billing will contribute to operating losses. 
   Succeeding in Value-Based Care  
This publication identifies and outlines the necessary characteristics of a fully-functioning clinically integrated network (CIN). What it doesnât do is detail how hospitals and providers can participate in the value-based care environment during the development process.
One common misconception is that the CIN canât do anything significant until it has obtained the FTCâs âclinically integratedâ stamp of approval. While the network must satisfy the FTCâs definition of clinical integration before single signature contracting for FFS rates and contracts can legally start, hospitals and providers can enjoy three key benefits during the development process. 
   Therapy: Benefits at All Levels of Care  
Nearly half of all Medicare beneficiaries treated in the hospital will need post-acute care services after discharge. For these patients, a stay in an inpatient rehabilitation facility, skilled nursing facility or other post-acute care setting comes between hospital and home. 
   Does Your Budgeting Process Lack Accountability?  
With the proper process, tools, and feedback mechanisms in place, budgeting can be a valuable exercise for organizations while helping hold organizational leaders accountable. Having a proper monthly variance review process is one of the most critical factors in creating a more efficient and accurate budget. Monthly variance reporting puts parameters around what is to be expected during the upcoming budget entry process. 
   Cost Accounting: the Key to Cost Management and Profitability  
Managing the cost of patient care is the top strategic priority of most hospital CFOs today. As healthcare shifts to more data-driven decision making, having clear visibility into key volume, cost and profitability measures across clinical service lines is becoming increasingly important for both long-range and tactical planning activities. In turn, the cost accounting function in healthcare provider organizations is becoming an increasingly important and strategic function. This whitepaper includes five strategies for efficient and accurate cost accounting and service line analytics and keys to overcoming the associated challenges.</content>

    <content type="text">The Trump administration has proposed that insurance plans providing drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries will no longer be forced to cover six hitherto âprotectedâ drug classes. The classesâwhich include drugs for psychiatric conditions, cancer and immune diseasesâare among the priciest of all drugs and account for as much as 33 percent of total outpatient drug spending under Part D of Medicare. 
 
Under the proposal, Medicare plans could âexclude from their formularies protected class drugs with price increases that are greater than inflation, as well as certain new drug formulations that are not a significant innovation over the original product,â says Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
 
In 2014, the Obama administration sought the same âprice reliefâ for Medicare but was defeated by drug industry lobbyists. At the time, 100 pills of the âprotectedâ psychiatric drug Abilify cost $1,644, 100 pills of the âprotectedâ psych drug Geodon cost $958, 100 pills of the âprotectedâ psychiatric drug Invega cost $1,789 and 100 pills of the âprotectedâ psych drug Seroquel cost $2,000. Since then, even pricier psychiatric drugs have emerged as well as 6-digit cancer drugs. 
 
The Obama proposal was roundly defeated by drug industry funded groups  Â  like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). NAMI r eceived $23 million in just two years from drug makers and is heavily financed by them. 
 
The proposal âundermines a key protection for some of the sickest, most vulnerable Medic beneficiaries,â said NAMI lobbyist Andrew Sperling, one of many voices that defeated the proposal. âYou get much better outcomes when a doctor can work with patients to figure out which medications will work best.â He might have added, as long as the taxpayer pays. 
 
Such drug industry tactics are well known. âWhen insurers balk at reimbursing patients for new prescription medications, these groups typically swing into action, rallying sufferers to appear before public and consumer panels, contact lawmakers, and provide media outlets a human face to attach to a cause,âÂ  writesÂ  Melissa Healy of the Los Angeles Times about this well known Pharma tactic to loot Medicare dollars. 
 
The six protected drug classes are not the only example of lobbyist-initiated regulations which protect nothing more than drug industry profits and its expensive psychiatric drugs, many of which have cheaper alternatives. In T exas, a Medicaid âdecision treeâ called the Texas Medical Algorithm Project was instituted that literally requires doctors to prescribe the newest psychiatric drugs first. It was, not surprisingly, funded by the Johnson &amp; Johnson linked Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 
 
Already drug industry lobbyists are berating the new Trump Medicare proposal on behalf of the âsickest, most vulnerable Medicare beneficiariesâ who they say will be hurt if taxpayers wonât fund its 4 and 5 digit priced drugs. Yet few to none of the newer psychiatric drugs show clear improvements over cheaper ones and they all lack the safety profiles of older drugs that are widely in use. In fact, some drug safety groups recommend waiting several years to take a new drugââuntil its safety has been demonstrated through longer and wider use. 
 
Will this cost-saving Medicare proposal be defeated as it was in 2014?

Transcript: 

Hi, Iâm Samantha DiGrande for The Center for Biosimilars Â® , your resource for clinical, regulatory, business, and policy news in the rapidly changing world of biosimilars. 

Here are the top 5 biosimilars articles for the week of December 3. 

Number 5: A new study found that CT-P10, a rituximab biosimilar, demonstrated comparable progression-free survival, sustained response, and overall survival with the reference product in patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma. 

Number 4: The American College of Rheumatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation released a new treatment guideline for psoriatic arthritis that contains evidence-based recommendations on caring for patients with this inflammatory disease. 

Number 3: A recent study found that using only tbo-filgrastim in treating neutropenia for patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy in the Veterans Health Administration led to cost savings. 

Number 2: A study presented at the American Society of Hematologyâs annual meeting found that subcutaneously administered rituximab has the potential to save both cost and time. 

Number 1: Celltrion has announced that the European Medicines Agency has accepted for review an extension marketing authorization application for a subcutaneous formulation of the companyâs biosimilar infliximab, CT-P13. 

Finally, last week, our e-newsletter asked if the FDAâs efforts to increase competition are enough to curb rising drug prices.

    <content type="text">Maryland is moving

toward cheaper drugs

An op-ed by Brian D. Pieninck, president and CEO of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, highlighted two serious and interrelated issues: the soaring cost of prescription drugs and the need to make health insurance as affordable as possible in Maryland ("BlueCrossBlueShield CEO: Md. should consider insurance mandate," Nov. 29). I applaud him for his willingness to find long-term, innovative solutions that will protect consumers across the state and build on the short-term but very significant reinsurance program which CareFirst helped to get enacted during the 2018 General Assembly session.

Maryland should take two key steps in response. First, we must stabilize drug costs so no Marylander ever has to decide between paying the rent and buying their prescriptions. Drugs don't work if people can't afford them. We are working to create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board that would ensure that people in Maryland are charged fair and affordable costs for their medicines. We have broad support for this important legislation in the 2019 General Assembly session, with Sen. Katherine Klausmeier (Baltimore County) and Del. Joseline PeÃ±a-Melnyk (Prince George's) serving as lead sponsors. Super majorities in both houses have already expressed support for the measure. Second, we echo Mr. Pieninck's call for restoring an individual insurance mandate in the state. We believe the best way to accomplish this would be through our proposed "health insurance down payment" plan which would require Marylanders without health insurance to pay a state penalty that could serve as a "down payment" for purchasing health insurance coverage. This will lead to tens of thousands of people having insurance, which will bring down premium costs for everyone. Sen. Brian Feldman (Montgomery) and Del. PeÃ±a-Melnyk will be lead sponsors of this legislation which also enjoys broad support in the public and among legislators.

We look forward to working with CareFirst on these proposals to help make health care more affordable in Maryland.

City shouldn't close Monarch Academy

As a Baltimore City teacher, I found myself both delighted and disheartened by the recent article in The Baltimore Sun ("Attacks on Baltimore school employees revive discussions about student discipline," Nov. 29). As stated in the article, system CEO Sonja Santelises and her administration plan to focus on "student wholeness" by implementing restorative practices, improving school climate and teaching de-escalation strategies.

As a teacher at Monarch Academy Baltimore City, I am proud to be part of a school community where our mission and daily practice supports "student wholeness." Each day, the staff at Monarch Academy Baltimore City works to ensure that the needs of the whole child are met. This includes mental health services, transportation, food, clothing and most recently access to affordable housing. Each day our students are provided with a safe and nurturing environment, brain-based strategies, and social and emotional learning to ensure their success inside and outside the classroom. These reasons, among many others, are why I have chosen to be a teacher at Monarch Academy.

Although I am delighted that Baltimore City Public Schools plans to focus on "student wholeness," I am extremely disheartened by the recommendation to close Monarch Academy Baltimore City. Closing Monarch Academy would mean closing an institution that services the "student wholeness" of 1,000 children and an entire community. I invite Ms. Santelises to visit Monarch Academy Baltimore City in order to see first hand how we support the whole child academically, socially, and emotionally. As Ms. Santelises stated in the article in reference to student discipline, "each situation deserves to be looked at within the proper context." I ask the same for Monarch Academy. We are a school that supports the whole child, the whole family and the whole community.

Panhandling laws

should be enforced

In his Dec. 5 column regarding the tragic death of Jacqueline Smith, Dan Rodricks said that "panhandlers are everywhere and almost nowhere act violently to those who give them money" ("Killing of woman helping panhandler is another temptation to lose faith in Baltimore. Here's how to keep it instead," Dec. 4).

Years ago, as county executive, I led a successful effort to prohibit panhandling in Anne Arundel County. While fatalities may be a rare occurrence, panhandling is a public safety hazard at all times, sometimes involving accidents and confrontations. Police officers, who are required to enforce the law, have been trained to advise homeless panhandlers of available social services, while also informing them that their solicitation from highway median strips is illegal. Where panhandling is prohibited, the law should be enforced.

(Reuters) â Healthcare spending growth in the United States slowed for the second year in a row in 2017, mainly due to slower spending growth for hospital care, physician and clinical services as well as retail prescription drugs, according to a report from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
 
National health spending grew at a rate of 3.9 percent to $3.5 trillion, the health agency reported on Thursday. In 2016, it grew at 4.8 percent. The low rate of spending growth in 2017 was similar to the average annual growth rate of 3.9 percent seen between 2008 and 2013. 
 
Last year, a decline in growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed, a shift to lower-cost generics, and slower uptake of high-cost treatments â notably those that treat hepatitis C, contributed to slower growth in prescription drug spending. 
 
The CMS had earlier this year projected spending to rise 5.3 percent in 2018, reflecting rising prices of medical goods and services and higher Medicaid costs, expecting the upward trend to continue for the next decade. 
 
Growth in spending for private health insurance and the governmentâs program for the poor, Medicaid, also slowed, while spending on the Medicare program remained relatively flat.

    <content type="text">Health care spending as a percentage of gross domestic product remained relatively stable in 2017, despite a slowdown in the growth of spending. 

Total health care spending in the United States was $3.5 trillion in 2017, an increase of 3.9% from 2016, according to data released Dec. 6 by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. 

The growth rate was down from that of 2016 (4.8%) but similar to growth rates experienced during 2008-2013, according to the research article in Health Affairs . 

âThe slower growth in health care spending in 2017 resulted primarily from slower growth in hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs, with residual use and intensity of these goods and services contributing substantially to the trend,â Anne B. Martin, an economist in the CMS Office of the Actuaryâs National Health Statistics Group, and her colleagues wrote. 

The report notes that slower growth in the use and intensity of health care goods and services in 2017 âmay have been affected by slower growth in overall health insurance enrollment, as the insured share of the population fell from 91.1% in 2016 to 90.9% in 2017.â 

Spending on hospital care increased 4.6% to $1.1 trillion in 2017 and accounted for 33% of total health care spending; however, growth was slower than in the previous year (5.6%). Ms. Martin and her colleagues noted that growth in outpatient visits slowed while growth in inpatient days increased at about the same rate and prices in hospital care grew in 2017 to 1.7% from 1.2% in the previous year. 

Spending on physician and clinical services grew 4.2% in 2017 to $694.3 billion and accounted for 20% of total health care spending. The growth rate is down from the previous year (5.6%) and a recent peak of 6% in 2015. 

âAlthough spending growth for both physician services and clinical services slowed in 2017, the growth rate for the latter (5.0%) continued to out pace the rate for the former (3.9%), as spending for most types of outpatient care centers contributed to the stronger growth in spending for clinical services,â Ms. Martin and her colleagues reported. 

They attributed the slowdown to non-price factors, such as slower growth in the use and intensity of physician and clinical services, although price growth for physician and clinical services increased 0.4% in 2017, up from 0.2% in 2016. 

Spending on retail prescription drugs grew 0.4% in 2017 to $333.4 billion and accounted for 10% of total national health spending. It is the slowest growth rate increase since 2012, a year that saw a number of blockbuster drugs lose patent protection. This was down from a growth rate of 2.3% in 2016 and down from recent rates of 12.4% in 2014 and 8.9% in 2015. 

âSlower growth in non-price factors, such as the use and mix of retail prescription drugs â and, to a lesser extent, in retail prescription drug prices â contributed to the slower overall growth in retail prescription drug spending in 2017,â according to the authors. Key factors included slower growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed, the continued shift to lower-cost generics, and slower growth in the volume of high-cost drugs, particularly those used to treat hepatitis C. Price decreases in generics and lower increases for existing brand-name drugs also contributed to the lower spending growth in 2017. 

Ms. Martin and her colleagues highlighted the slower growth rate in the number of prescriptions (1.8% in 2017, down from 2.3% in 2016) âresulted in large part from a decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed for drugs used to treat pain.â 

Medicare spending, which represents 20% of all national health care spending in 2017 ($705.9 billion), grew 4.2%, a slight decline from the 4.3% growth in 2016. Enrollment growth slowed slightly to 2.5% in 2017 from 2.7% in the previous year, while in the same time frame, per-enrollee expenditures increased slightly to 1.7% from 1.6%. Slower growth in fee-for-service Medicare spending was offset by faster growth in spending by Medicare private health plans. 

Medicaid spending reached $581.9 billion (17% of national health care spending), and the growth rate slowed for the third straight year, increasing 2.9% in 2017 versus 4.2% in 2016. The slower growth âwas influenced by a deceleration in enrollment growth and a reduction in the Medicaid net cost of health insurance as the federal government recovered payments from managed care organizations based on their favorable prior-period experience,â the authors stated. Enrollment growth has been decelerating following a peak of growth of 11.9% in 2014 because of states that elected to expand Medicaid eligibility, which was followed by 3 years of slower growth rates of 4.9%, 3.0% and 2.0% in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Per-enrollee spending also slowed to 0.9% growth in 2017 from a rate of 1.2% in 2016, attributed to âthe decline in government administration and the net cost of insurance.â

    <content type="text">CMS actuaries reported Thursday that overall national healthcare spending growth slowed for the second year in a row, due to slower spending growth in every area: hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs. The slower pace also stemmed from the expanded coverage effects of the Affordable Care Act taking root in 2014 and 2015 and then falling off, as well as the decrease in usage of hepatitis C prescription drugs. 
CMS actuaries reported Thursday that overall national healthcare spending growth slowed for the second year in a row, due to slower spending growth in every area: hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs. The slower pace also stemmed from the expanded coverage effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) taking root in 2014 and 2015 and then falling off, as well as the decrease in usage of hepatitis C prescription drugs. 
The report, which was published online in Health Affairs , said healthcare spending grew at a rate of 3.9% to $3.5 trillion, or $10,739 per person. The 3.9% rate follows growth of 4.8% in 2016 and 5.8% in 2015, and falls back to the annual average rate during the period 2008 to 2013, which predated the ACAâs implementation and also included the last recession. 

In addition, the rate of growth was also below what was expected in a 10-year projection report released earlier this year , which forecast that healthcare spending would increase 4.6% last year. 

Part of the reason why growth slowed is because nominal gross domestic product (GDP) increased 4.2% (similar to the healthcare increase of 3.9%) from 2.7% a year earlier, so the 2 rates converged. As a result, the share of the economy devoted to healthcare in 2017 stabilized at 17.9%, essentially flat relative to what was seen in 2016 (18%). 

In addition, spending growth slowed in 2017 for private health insurance and Medicaid, while Medicare spending remained relatively flat. 

On a per capita basis, national health spending grew 3.2% in 2017, compared to growth of 4% in 2016. A deceleration in the residual use and intensity of goods and services was a primary factor in the overall slowdown, increasing 1.1% in 2017, compared with 2.1% in 2016. 

âPrior to the coverage expansions and temporary high growth in prescription drug spending during that same period, health spending was growing at historically low rates,â said Anne Martin, an economist in the Office of the Actuary at CMS and lead author of theÂ  Health Affairs Â article. âIn 2017, health care spending growth returned to these lower rates and the health spending share of GDP stabilized for the first time since 2013.â 

The report also said that slower growth in use and intensity may have been affected by slower growth in overall health insurance enrollment, as the percentage of those with insurance ticked slightly downward, from 91.1% in 2016 to 90.9% last year. On a call with reporters to discuss the results, the authors of the report said they could not make future predictions for the coming year, or if that trend would continue. 

Today's report was released on the same dayÂ CMS released the latest enrollment numbers for the ACA individual marketplace. The report showed that fewer people are enrolling in exchange insurance compared with last year. The enrollment period ends December 15. 

While use and intensity of all parts of healthcare slowed, price in some sectors did not, the report said. Medical price growth accelerated slightly, increasing 1.6% in 2017 compared with 1.3% in 2016, because of faster underlying inflation. 

By payers, the annual report found that: 

Private health insurance (PHI) grew 4.2% ,  reaching $1.2 trillion in 2017. PHI accounted for 34% of total national health spending; PHI spending increased 4.2% in 2017, slower than the growth of 6.2% in 2016. Factors behind the slowdown included slower growth in medical benefits and a decline in fees and taxes resulting from the suspended collection of the health insurance plan fee in 2017. Enrollment in PHI also slowed slightly, increasing 0.2% in 2017 compared with growth of 0.4% in 2016. On a per enrollee basis, PHI spending increased 4% in 2017, which was lower than the previous 2 years. 

Medicare spending grew 4.2% to $705.9 billion in 2017, accounting for 20% of total healthcare expenditures. It was about the same rate in 2016 and 2017. Per Medicare enrollee, spending growth increased 1.7% in 2017, similar to the 1.6% growth rate in 2016. Fee-for-service Medicare spending accounted for two-thirds of overall Medicare spending in 2017 and increased 1.4%, slowing from 2.6% in 2016. Medicare Advantage, which the Trump administration has been promoting heavily, increased 10% in 2017 following growth of 8.1% in 2016. 

Medicaid expenditures grew 2.9% to $581.9 billion in 2017. Medicaid spending growth slowed for the third straight year, increasing 2.9% in 2017 compared with 4.2% in 2016. Medicaid makes up 17% of totalÂ national health expenditures. The slower growth came from a lag in enrollment growth, from 3% in 2016 to 2% in 2017.Â The report noted that Medicaid supplemental payments to hospitals continued to fall in 2017. 

In addition, last year states that expanded Medicaid to eligible adults were required to fund 5% of the costs. In previous years the costs were fully funded by the federal government. Medicaid state and local spending grew 6.4% in 2017, faster than the federal spending growth rate of 0.8% in 2017. Federal spending growth was helped in part because of payments recovered from Medicaid managed care plans. The last time that state and local spending increased more rapidly than federal spending was in 2012, the report said. 

By goods and services, the report found that: 

Hospital spending grew 4.6% to $1.1 trillion in 2017. That is below growth of 5.6% in 2016 and 4.6% in 2017. There was slower growth in use and intensity of goods and services, due primarily to slower growth in outpatient visits.Â Price growth for hospital services, however, ticked upward by 1.7% compared with a 1.2% gain in 2016. 

Physician and clinical services grew 4.2%, reaching $694.3 billion last year, below a growth rate of 5.6% in 2016 and 4.2% in 2017. Spending growth for clinical services (5%) outstripped growth for physician services (3.9%), due to the influence of outpatient care centers. 

Retail prescription drug spending grew 0.4% to $333.4 billion in 2017. Growth in spending for retail prescription drugs increased 0.4% in 2017, the slowest rate of growth since 2012, when a large number of blockbuster drugs lost patent protection, driving down prices and total spending. In 2017, the number of prescriptions dispensed fell, driven in largely by a drop in the number of opioid prescriptions. The shift to lower-cost generic drugs continued, and there was slower growth in the volume of some high-cost drugs, such as for hepatitis C, now that most of those patients have been cured. 

In addition, out-of-pocket spending by consumers grew 2.6% to $365.5 billion in 2017, below the 4.4% seen in 2</content>

    <content type="text">One can get an excellent sense of the pace of cancer care innovation and the controversies and failures that are part of this grand narrative by tracking cancer-related cover stories in TIME magazine. 1-10Â  Dating back 70 years, these cover stories have told the dynamic story of the failed promises, bold advances, and unintended consequences of advances in cancer treatment and their impact upon patients affected by this diverse set of disorders. In ready this series of stories, it is difficult not to wonder how this narrative will continue to evolve over the next 10 to 20 years.Â  
In the early 1970s and 1980s, stories in the popular media embraced the idea of anticancer âmagic bulletsâ that would prove the key to providing cures for all types of cancer. In the end, there was no magic, just a growing appreciation for the fact that curing cancer is not based upon some underlying simplicity in cancer biology or fortune in identifying a universal cure. Instead, there was a growing realization that conquering cancer would require a deep level of scientific inquiry into the genetic and molecular underpinnings of each type of cancer, so that individual cures could potentially be crafted to manipulate the underlying biology of the disease. The requisite quantum intellectual leap from a belief in magic bullets toward a mindset that embraced the inherent complexity of cancer biology led to the âprecision medicineâ mindset. The future of cancer care lies in this continuing, dynamic journey of discovery while ensuring that our systems of delivering care can match this clinical promise, so that patients can benefit equitably from these advances in care.Â  

The promise of targeted anticancer therapeutics was first demonstrated through the extraordinary success of imatinib (Gleevec) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the treat- ment of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). By exploiting the mechanism of action of the unique fusion protein created by gene fusion specific to CML, daily dosing of the TKIs could produce a significant percentage of molecular complete remissions for a population of patients whose prognosis prior to the advent of these innovative therapeutics was poor, with a median survival of less than 3 years. 11 

Although the information derived from convention cytogenetic studies on cancer have had some impact upon the development of targeted anticancer therapeutics, the Human Genome Project has produced a veritable Rosetta Stone for identifying unique tumor-related mutations in the cancer cell genome and leveraging this information in the pursuit of innovative targeted therapeutics. 12 This process has been accelerated by increasing numbers of patients with cancer whose tumors have undergone genomic testing, including whole exome sequencing, as well as the availability of supercomputer analysis of these data. The availability of supercomputer-based analytics allows for very high throughput of immense amounts of unstructured genomic data that can help identify potentially relevant cancer-related mutations. 13 These advances in our understanding of tumor genomics and the identification of new tumor neo-antigens as marks for targeted therapeutics and immune-oncologic therapeutics have accelerated the pace of development for these therapeutics.Â  

In a relatively short period of time, these data and other data obtained from basic science research directed at identifying tumor genomics and potential targets for innovative immuno-onco- logical treatments have produced significant, tangible results for patients with previously unmet cancer care needs. Earlier this year, in a randomized phase III trials of checkpoint inhibitors added to the standard treatment of nonâsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients without mutations of EGFR or ALK produced a significant prolongation of survival and improvements in progression-free survival. 14 The standard of care for patients with NSCLC has evolved dramatically during this period, with inclusion of genomic testing as part of the assessment of patients with advanced disease prior to treatment. Moreover, these treatment guidelines alsoÂ reflect increasing therapeutic options, including targeted therapeutics for patients with selected mutations of EGFR, ALK, BRAF, MET, ROS1 . 15 Many types of cancer that have proven historically refractory to standard chemotherapeutic approaches may respond dramatically to targeted immune-oncological agents, often producing an excellent quality of life for patients affected by these diseases. 16 This pace of innovation continues to increase at a previously unprecedented pace. Between 2014 and 2017, there were more than 50 FDA approvals for targeted anticancer therapeutics. 17 Although some of these reflect approval of a single agent for multiple indications, most reflect a breadth of therapeutics that include bispecific molecules, checkpoint inhibitors, small molecules, and monoclonal antibodies that demonstrated effectiveness in a broad array of tumors, including many cancers that have been refractory to standard chemotherapeutic approaches. Moreover, the future pipeline for new, targeted anticancer therapeutics looks robust. 18 As more potential therapeutic targets are identified through genomic, molecular, proteomic, and metabolomic investigation and data analysis, there is enormous hope that the promise of precision medicine will translate into greater opportunities for patients with historically refractory and poor-prognosis cancers. 19 These advances portend a future in which cancer survival rates will continue to rise and the number of cancer survivors in the United States will continue to grow. 

Yet, inasmuch as the future is likely to bring enormous progress and innovative treatments for patients with unmet care needs, it is also likely to bring a series of increasingly complex challenges to our healthcare system. The first of these relates to concerns about the financial sustainability of delivering these innovations, given their rapidly escalating price tags. In a recent study, the average cost of an anticancer drug approved between 2006 and 2015 rose more that 5-fold to an average of $13,176 per month. 20 Although the challenge of paying for new therapeutics with an average annual cost of $160,000 sounds daunting, the example of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapeutics stands as a bellwether for some of the expected cost challenges to come. Thus far, 2 CAR T-cell products have been approved, with the possibility of a third in the near term. These genetically modified agents are manufactured on a per-patient basis for the treatment of young patients with relapsed, refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), respectively. Both products have demonstrated clinical activity that is superior to historical approaches, and the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review report on 

CAR T-cell therapies found that these products met the threshold for cost-effectiveness for both treatment indications. 21 Yet the line-item procurement costs of the 2 commercially available therapeutics ($373,000 for DLBCL and $475,000 for B-cell ALL) has been met with significant concern. 22 These represent some of the most expensive therapeutics released to date in the United States. This has led policymakers to wrestle publically with the question of how to deal with therapeutics whose cost is seen as a challenge to the sustainability of our government-based payment systems. In the 2019 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) rule, a large part of the cost of delivering these treatments was left unreimbursed, thus leaving the hospitals and healthcare systems that offered these therapeutics to cover half or more of the cost of product procurement alone. 23 This issue seems to have had a chilling effect upon the availability of these therapeutics to patients who may need them. Recently, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD, said the failure to resolve the issue of CAR T-cell reimbursement could stifle future therapeutic innovations for patients with cancer. 24 

Although the rising costs of pharmaceuticals and engineered therapeutics pose a challenge, it is inappropriate to consider the issue of therapeutic cost in isolation. In one study, a review of the cost of care for third- and fourth-line treatments for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL ranged from $600,000 to $750,000. 25 This is a sum that may actually exceed the cost of much more effective care for this population of patients. The difference is that the transactions costs associated with CAR T-cell procurement have created a perception of greater overall costs where that may not, in fact, be true. 

The idea of shifting toward payment for value, rather than volume, is a concept that is routinely cited as an essential principle in gaining control over care-related costs. Experts and national leadersâ from Michael E. Porter, PhD, MBA, and Thomas H. Lee, MD, both of Harvard, to former HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwellâhave all embraced this as an essential principle of creating a high-quality, financially sustainable system of care delivery. 26,27 Yet we have made amazingly little global progress in this regard in creating a national value-based care model in the oncology domain. There are some important pilot projects, including the Oncology Care Model (OCM) from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, but we have yet to see the creation of a national ecosystem that consistently fosters and rewards high-value oncology care, especially a system that can support and reward the appropriate and effective use of high-cost therapeutics. 

Whereas it is easy to become enthralled with the unprecedented pace of innovation around genomic diagnostic technologies and advances in targeted therapeutics, these things risk becoming intellectual curiosities unless we can create an ecosystem that aligns financial incentives with providing patients with the most effective suite of services throughout their cancer journey. For some this might entail treatments with a recently approved therapeutic, while for others this might be a system that ensures that compassion and palliation are equally valued when they represent the most patient-centered options for a particular patient. One of the benefits of the OCM is that it has brought the idea that cancer care is delivered throughout a series of episodes that should align around the needs of patients and their families. As knowledge is gleaned from this pilot project, the hope is that the concept of value-based care may grow from an aspirational platitude to a fully realized ecosystem that provides patient-centered care and sustainable reimbursement for physicians and healthcare systems across the breadth of a patientâs entire cancer journey. Creating this system will require that big data science and information technology can be fully leveraged to carefully define clinical risk through rigorous patient segmentation (based upon demographic, diagnostic, genomic, and goals of care data) in order to reimburse a system of care that is focused upon the patientâs needs throughout the continuum of care. Key elements of this ecosystem, including the creation of big data analytic models and care delivery frameworks, are in progress. 28-32 Data gleaned from this set of experiences can help to create the scaffolding upon which a better, more effective, sustainable system can be created.</content>

    <content type="text">If you're not feeling well or have a routine health issue, do you go ahead and get it checked out or put if off because of the cost? 

And, let's say you do make an appointment and go. Afterward, do you fill the prescription you received or do financial concerns stop you? 

We wondered how often people deferred or skipped care because of cost, so we asked in the latest NPR-IBM Watson Health Health Poll. The survey queried more than 3,000 households nationwide in July. 

For starters we asked if people had postponed, delayed or canceled some kind of health care service, such as a doctor's appointment or medical procedure, because of cost in the preceding three months. About 1 in 5 people had done so. 

"I am pretty impressed that it was only 20 percent that had postponed or delayed or canceled health care services," says Dr. Anil Jain , vice president and chief health information officer for IBM Watson Health. "I thought it would be higher." 

The proportion of people who said cost had deterred them from getting care varied by age, with a third of people under 35 saying it had been a problem compared with only 8 percent of people 65 and older. 

Jain says one area that may not be getting enough attention is preventive care. "I think it's important that young people never feel the need to forgo or delay preventive services," he says. 

We also asked people if they â or members of their household â had difficulty paying for some kind health care service in the preceding three months. A quarter said yes. And again the strain varied by age, with 41 percent of people under 35 saying they had experienced difficulty while only 11 percent of people 65 and older had. 

Almost all the respondents to the survey, about 97 percent, had some form of health coverage. The sample size of respondents reporting no insurance wasn't large enough to support further analysis within the uninsured population. 

We also asked specifically about people's experience receiving and filling prescriptions. In the three months before the survey, two-thirds of people said they'd received a prescription. A vast majority of older Americans â 84 percent â said they'd received a prescription, while 39 percent of people under 35 had. 

Almost everyone who said they'd gotten a prescription went ahead and filled it â 97 percent overall. 

The cost of prescriptions appeared to be a bigger concern for younger people, with 38 percent of those under 35 saying they had difficulty paying for their medicine. Only 9 percent of people 65 and older said they had the same problem. 

With an eye on costs, we asked people if they were familiar with discount coupons provided by drugmakers, one way to defray out-of-pocket expenses related to prescriptions. About two-thirds of people said they were aware of these coupons. 

In a follow-up question, we asked if people had used this kind of coupon. About a third of people said they had. Among older people, 65 and up, the proportion was quite a bit lower â only 19 percent said they'd used this kind of coupon. 

Drug costs weigh on people as deductibles and copayments add up. 

"Despite insurance, we feel that more people are experiencing a higher out-of-pocket burden due to medications," says Thomas Goetz, head of research for GoodRx , a clearinghouse for drug pricing information, discounts and coupons. "Insurance is increasingly not covering that expense as much as it used to." 

Manufacturers' coupons are geared toward brand-name medicines, only one part of the financial challenge. "The burden for most Americans is largely with these generic drugs that are considered very routine to prescribe and are getting more expensive," Goetz says. "A $20 drug becomes $100." 

Think of all the sacrifices people are making to avoid skipping prescriptions, he says. "We take these medications because they're supposed to makes us feel better, and the price doesn't always have that effect." 

The nationwide poll has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points. You can find the questions and full results here .</content>

    <content type="text">The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicesâ Office of the Actuaryâs latest analysis estimates that health care spending growth slowed in 2017 to a rate more akin to that seen between 2008 and 2013. Spending hit $3.5 trillion in 2017, growing at a rate of 3.9%, which CMSâ report noted followed two straight years that saw a slowdown in health care spending growth â 2016âs 4.8% followed 2015âs 5.8%. 
 
Retail prescription drugs, in particular, saw the lowest growth rate since 2012 â 0.4%. Expenditures for the category reached $333.4 billion in 2017, making up roughly 10% of overall spending. CMSâ report attributed the slowdown to slower growth in prescription dispensing, as well as a shift to generics and slower growth in volume among high-cost drug categories, particularly hepatitis C. 
 
While private health insurance and Medicaid saw spending growth slow, Medicare spending growth was relatively flat. CMSâ study, which will be published in the January 2019 issue of Health Affairs , also noted that because U.S. gross domestic product growth increased by 4.2%, health care spending held steady at 17.9% of GDP â marking the first year since 2013 that its share of spending did not increase. 
 
âPrior to the coverage expansions and temporary high growth in prescription drug spending during that same period, health spending was growing at historically low rates,â said Anne Martin, an economist in the Office of the Actuary at CMS and first author of the Health Affairs article. âIn 2017, health care spending growth returned to these lower rates and the health spending share of GDP stabilized for the first time since 2013.â 
 
The report also highlights 5% spending growth for clinical services in 2017, which outstripped spending growth for physician services, which came in at 3.9%. Spending for outpatient care centers wereÂ contributors to stronger clinical services spending growth. Overall, the report points to a decline in the use and intensity of goods and services as a key driver in the slowdown of health care spending growth.</content>

    <content type="text">Memorial Hermann Health System reduced its fall rate to one of the lowest in the nation in 2016 -- using clinical decision support (CDS) and for that was honored with a HIMSS Davies Award of Excellence 

The Davies recognizes outstanding achievement of organizations that have utilized health information technology to substantially improve patient outcomes and value. 
 
To achieve such success, a team at Memorial Hermann used the AGS Beers Criteria, a resource that helps physicians find potential medication-related dangers that often lead to geriatric patient falls. Memorial Hermann started using CDS oversight with the support of a Beers Criteria workgroup led by physicians, pharmacists, medical informatics professionals and an acute care medical informatics committee, according to HIMSS. 
 
Memorial Hermann used CDS in the form of order sentences and alerts to limit the ordering of medications for the elderly patient population. The EHRâs ability to add filters for age and conditions, in addition to dose range checking alerts, improved the automation and reliability of the CDS alerts. 
 
WHY IT MATTERS 
 
âEvery second of every day in the U.S., an older adult falls, making falls the number one cause of injuries and deaths from injury among older Americans,â according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2014, CDC reported some 29 million falls by older Americans, resulting in seven million injuries at an estimated $31 billion in Medicare costs. 
 
Falls are a growing public health issue, particularly with the surging Baby Boomer population, says the National Council on Aging (NCOA). 
 
âOlder adult falls are increasing and, sadly, often herald the end of independence,â said former CDC Director Tom Frieden. âHealthcare providers can make fall prevention a routine part of care in their practice, and older adults can take steps to protect themselves.â 
 
THE LARGER TREND 
 
More and more providers are using advanced predictive analytics to reduce falls. The 420-bed El Camino Hospital in California dramatically lowered its hospital fall rates , as we reported last April. âIt seemed like a lot of the efforts we tried were not getting us to where we wanted to be,â said chief nursing officer Cheryl Reinking, who helped spearhead the effort to transform the organizationâs fall prevention program. The effort involved going beyond traditional âpredictive analyticsâ into what Reinking called action-focused insights that allow providers to immediately respond and impact patient safety. 
 
We also reported about a blueprint for fall prevention that can also be applied to heart attacks and other patient conditions, using telehealth and predictive analytics applied to population health data. 
 
Physician and clinical informatics fellow Andrew Muth, MD, has developed a fall prevention program that uses predictive analytics to identify veterans who are at risk of falling. Some factors that can lead to a higher risk of falling include taking strong medication for pain, narcotics like benzodiazepine or antipsychotics, which can cause you to be a little shakier and more likely to fall. 
 
ON THE RECORD 
 
HIMSS senior director of quality and value-based care Jonathan French: âMemorial Hermann Health System significantly decreased the overall rate of unnecessary, high-risk medication orders, and are now leading the nation with the least amount of patient falls.â

    <content type="text">American Health Line's editors and writersÂ covered some big topics this year, including Medicare's 340B drug discount program pricing controversy, a major leadership departure at Mayo Clinic, and the year-one results from MACRA's Quality Payment Program.

Below, we round upÂ American Health Line's top five must-read Analysis &amp; Insight pieces of 2018. 1)Â The 340B drug pricing controversy, explainedÂ  -February 1

The controversy over Medicare's 340B drug discount program escalated late last year when CMS proposed major reimbursement cuts, including $1.6 billion in 2018 alone, and health care organizations countered with a lawsuit claiming the agency is jeopardizing patients' health.American Health Lineexplains what you should know about the 340B program: how it works, who it serves, why it's controversial, and what reimbursement cuts could mean for providers.

Since our story ran... CMS has moved forward with the planned 2018 cuts, and in November,Â finalizedÂ  a rule that extends the 2018 340B drug reimbursement cut to non-excepted, off-campus hospital departments that are paid under the physician fee schedule in 2019. Health care organizations in November resumed their legal fight to halt the cuts, after the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed their original lawsuit. The court had ruled the lawsuit was premature because the hospitals had not yet filed claims with CMS. That ruling was upheld by an appeals court in July.

2)Â Hospital ratings, decodedÂ  -April 13

Hospital ratings gets lots of buzz in the news, but do you know what factors actually determine a hospital's rank?American Health Linedove into four of the most popular lists-fromU.S. News &amp; World Report, Leapfrog, and more-to find out how they work and why they're so controversial.

Since our story ran... several of the leading hospital rating organizations have issued new lists. CMS in OctoberÂ updatedÂ  its Hospital Compare data, which showed 112 hospitals earned five-star ratings, 121 received a one-star rating, and 3,460 received either a two-, three-, or four-star rating. That same month, the Leapfrog GroupÂ announcedÂ  it will begin rating ambulatory surgery centers and hospital outpatient departments on patient safety and treatment outcomes in 2019. The following month, LeapfrogÂ awardedÂ  855 hospitals an "A" on safety, but gave more than 1,000 a "C" or below.U.S. Newsin August unveiled its Best HospitalsÂ rankingsÂ , with Mayo Clinic topping the publication's "Honor Roll" for the third year in a row.

3)Â Exclusive: Mayo Clinic CEO on why he's stepping down, Mayo's future, and moreÂ  -February 21

A day after announcing he will step down as Mayo Clinic's president and CEO at the end of 2018, John Noseworthy spoke withAmerican Health Lineabout his nine-year tenure as chief executive, his approach to leading through change, and his advice for the Clinic's next leader.

Since our story ran... Noseworthy has continued to lead the Clinic, overseeing the launch of new initiatives, including aÂ partnershipÂ  with health insurer Medica to develop insurance policies that will allow patients throughout the country to receive complex care at Mayo Clinic. While Noseworthy largely has remained mum on his plans for next year, the Mayo Clinic Board of Trustees in August announced Gianrico Farrugia, the vice president of Mayo Clinic and CEO of Mayo Clinic in Florida, will succeed Noseworthy as president and CEO of the Clinic in January 2019. To learn more about Farrugia and the three biggest challenges he will take on when he assumes the role, read our exclusiveÂ Q&amp;AÂ  with Farrugia and Noseworthy.

4)Â MACRA made simple. (Really.)Â  -March 1

If you've followed the twists and turns in Medicare's latest changes to provider payments, you know that news coverage tends to devolve into alphabet soup: "CMS last year released a final rule for MACRA's QPP in 2018, with details on the MIPS and Advanced APM tracks." Confused yet? Don't worry-here'sAmerican Health Line's rundown of what you really need to know about MACRA's Quality Payment Program.

Since our story ran... CMSÂ publishedÂ  results for MACRA's Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) for the 2017 performance year, which marked the first year of the program. CMS data showed 93% of the 1,057,824 clinicians eligible to participate in MIPS will receive a positive payment adjustment in 2019, 2% will receive a neutral payment adjustment, and 5% will see a negative adjustment. However, CMS officials projected the number of MIPS-eligible clinicians who receive a positive payment adjustment will decline in future years as the agency increases performance thresholds. For example, clinicians in the 2017 performance year were not graded on how well they manage costs, but in 2018 cost-related measures will account for 10% of their overall score. That percentage willÂ increaseÂ  to 15% in 2019, with weights for quality measures declining by equal amounts.

5)Â How Trump can (and can't) change health care via waiversÂ  -September 7

Even though the GOP fell short in its efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) last year, the Trump administration remains dedicated to reforming health care through state-based waivers.American Health Linebreaks down the three most significant ways the White House could change health care via waivers-and explains the limits of waiver authority.

Since our story ran... a lot has changed. CMS in OctoberÂ announcedÂ  that the ACA's state innovation waivers will be renamed State Relief and Empowerment Waivers. The agency alsoÂ plansÂ  to give states new flexibilities to use the waivers to change how they administer ACA premium subsidies, allow resident to use federal subsidies, and implement reinsurance programs and other risk-stabilization strategies.</content>

    <content type="text">Healthcare and retirement Healthcare is a huge expense plaguing Americans today. Blue Cross and Blue Shield reports (November 2018) that rising prescription drug costs, treating chronic diseases and unhealthy lifestyle choices are the three key factors driving U.S. healthcare costs. They report that between 2010 and 2025 prescription drug prices are expected to increase by 136 percent.1 Treating chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and obesity along with unhealthy behaviors such as tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption are contributors as well. As you approach retirement, there are a few things to consider regarding healthcare: Life expectancy When considering healthcare and any expenses related to healthcare, life expectancy plays a major role as many individuals are living well into their 80âs and 90âs. According to the Social Security office, a man reaching age 65 today can expect to live until age 84.3 on average and a woman turning 65 today can expect to live to 86.7. And, one out of every four 65-year-olds today will live to be 90 years old and one out of 10 could live past the age of 95.2 Average cumulative health care expenses including premiums for a 65-year-old male in excellent health can be upwards of $345,000 and the estimate for a 65-year old male in poor health is about $246,000.3 Those in excellent health will spend less on an annual basis but more during their retirement years due to longer life expectancies.

Medicare limitation

Medicare is a health insurance plan for people who are age 65 or older and if you are not already getting benefits, you should contact the Social Security office about three months prior to your 65th birthday. Many individuals think that Medicare pays all medical expenses but in actuality, it doesnât pay for long-term care and only pays for a small piece of the first few days in a nursing home. Medicare doesnât cover everything and therefore Medicare supplemental insurance may be needed to pay for medical expenses which are not covered.

A longer life means higher healthcare costs Healthcare costs are going up just like the costs of everything else so not only are we living longer, but we are having to spend more money on healthcare today. Blue Cross and Blue Shield reported (November 2018) that healthcare spending in the United States is $3 trillion a year, placing a huge strain on families and businesses. The cost of caring for individuals with long-term medical conditions or chronic health problems, an increased cost of new medicines, procedures and technologies and a population who is living way into their 80âs and 90âs are all factors contributing to the rising dilemma.

A retirement income strategy A good financial plan starts with a retirement income strategy. The first step is to project your retirement income and then carefully estimate and analyze your expenses. The last step is to set aside enough reserve money to cover health care costs. If you are able to set up your retirement income plan well in advance of your actual retirement date, you will be able to assess the steps necessary to plan for enough money during retirement. Although not for everyone, postponing retirement by a year or so may help ensure all your expenses will be met during retirement. Each individual and family situation is different, therefore what is appropriate for your friend or colleague, may not be right for you.

Preparing for retirement is extremely important on so many fronts. One of the most important considerations is to analyze and plan for healthcare expenses as cumulative medical costs can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars during a retireeâs lifetime. Understand the components driving healthcare costs and then create a well thought out retirement plan to accommodate your individual or family needs.

    <content type="text">In spite of recent turbulence on the path, progress toward the recognition of the human right to health care for all Americans will go on. 
 
This was the prediction of Kathleen Sebelius, former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, who led the agency during the rollout of President Barack Obamaâs Affordable Care Act in 2010. Sebelius was discussing what the recent 2018 elections may mean for the future of health care in the U.S.

âThe march toward universal coverageâas slow and difficult and painful as it has beenâwill continue,â Sebelius said. âIâm just glad I got to play some small part in it.â 
 
Sebelius was the keynote speaker for a symposium titled âTransforming Health Care in America: Lessons from the Affordable Care Act.â The event, held on Dec. 4 at the Joseph B. Martin Conference Center at Harvard Medical School, celebrated the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Department of Health Care Policy at HMS.  
 
Many leaders in the field offered praise for the departmentâs significant contributions to improving the understanding and implementation of health care reforms. 
 
In a letter, Obama sent his thanks and congratulations to the department. 
 
âI want you to know how grateful I am for your steadfast commitment to our shared mission of ensuring all Americans know the peace of mind that comes with having quality, affordable health care,â Obama wrote. 
 
Past is prologue 
 
Barbara McNeil , the Ridley Watts Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and founding chair of the department, opened the symposium with a brief history of health care policy at HMS and a celebration of the accomplishments in research, education and service of department faculty and alumni. 
 
âHealth care policy touches our lives in ways that have profound implications on our health, our bank accounts, the productivity of our economy, and our politics,â McNeil said. 
 
The department, now a part of the Blavatnik Institute at HMS, was one of the first in the country embedded in a medical school. It has been a pioneer in an interdisciplinary research approach that draws on the strengths of clinicians, social scientists, statisticians (and increasingly, bioinformaticists) to understand the impacts of policy on health and to offer guidance for building better policies. 
 
While the symposium focused on lessons learned from implementation of the ACA, which McNeil said was âarguably the most important health legislation of the last half century,â the departmentâs efforts affect many other areas of research, care delivery and training, including evaluations of innovative care delivery like telemedicine, research into the challenges of and potential solutions for the opioid epidemic and suicide prevention tools for veterans. 
 
âWe all share a common sense of purpose and a desire to use our skills and insights as physicians and scientists to be a force for good,â McNeil said. 
 
Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow also welcomed speakers and guests and extended his congratulations to the department and to McNeil for three decades of leadership. 
 
Bacow noted that finding a sustainable solution to the challenge of providing quality health care was crucial to society. Lauding the departmentâs accomplishments in this area, Bacow noted that there is still much work to be done. 
 
âI look forward to working with all of you to make sure that we continue to make progress on some of the most important ideas of our time, to create opportunity for all and to ensure that we continue to make the world a better place,â Bacow said. 
 
HMS Dean George Q. Daley also offered his congratulations. 
 
âThe faculty, students and alumni of the department are helping to make people healthier by informing public policy and participating in crucial dialogues on the delivery and sustainability of care,â Daley said in a video address. âThe department plays an essential role in bringing evidence-based analysis to policymakers and to industry leaders.â 
 
Attendees included hundreds of supporters and friends of the department, past and current faculty and students from Harvard, as well as leaders from other universities, the insurance industry, the hospital industry and government health policy agencies. A livestream reached more than 20,000 viewers from as far away as Austria, Egypt, Greece, Nigeria, Pakistan, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. 
 
The symposium focused on personal reflections and research findings on several key facets of the implementation of the ACA. 
 
Sebelius provided a behind-the-scenes analysis of how the ACA was written and launched, as well as insights into how the current political scene is shaping the legacy of the act, often referred to as âObamacare.â 
 
In the next few years, Sebelius said, progress that will be made in increasing access to care is likely to come in the form of experimentation in states, especially those with newly elected Democratic governors who campaigned on improving health care access, and states with referenda on expanding Medicaid under the ACA, as well as states that are moving toward universal coverage under state laws, without more help from the federal government. Sebelius said the newly elected Democratic majority in Congress should be able to prevent further efforts to repeal or replace the ACA. 
 
Sebelius said she had expected that Republican opposition to the ACA would end in 2012 with the Supreme Court decision preserving the bulk of the law and with the reelection of Obama, but she was surprised by the âferocityâ of ongoing opposition to the ACA, which she said often seemed motivated more by political antagonism toward Obama than by real disagreements over questions of policy. 
 
The need for evidence 
 
The symposium also featured sessions on how the impact of the ACA was felt in the private insurance sector, in Medicaid and in efforts to change the way that health care services are paid for. Each session began with brief research presentations by HMS faculty members and colleagues. 
 
The researchers reported on the successes and failures of different aspects of the ACA.Â  One common theme was the underlying complexity of the health care system, and the complicated, sometimes chaotic, nature of efforts to reform it. 
 
Some interventions worked well in some places and poorly in others, the researchers said, while other reform efforts made a significant difference in the cost of treatment for some conditions, but not for others. 
 
This complexity, they said, makes it unlikely that the search for a single solution that can overcome all of the obstacles to improving affordability, access and quality of care will succeed. 
 
The presentations were followed by responses from commentators who were instrumental in the passage and implementation of the ACA, including Donald Berwick , a lecturer in the department, now a senior fellow at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and a former administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; Sherry Glied, Dean of the NYU Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and former assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Jeanne Lambrew, senior fellow at the Century Foundation and former deputy assistant to the president for health policy); Cindy Mann, a partner at Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips, LLP and former deputy administrator and director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services; and Peter Slavin , President, Massachusetts General Hospital and HMS professor of health care policy. 
 
A researcherâs goal is to make predictions, gather data, evaluate outcomes and present evidence, said Michael McWilliams , the Warren Alpert Foundation Professor of Health Care Policy and a professor of medicine at HMS, in his presentation on payment reform. 
 
This goal has become increasingly challenging in the current policy climate, he said. 
 
âEvidence is under siege,â McWilliams said. âSometimes it feels like we are losing the battle against stories and slogans and anecdotes.â 
 
Sebelius, who was named the 2018 Seidman Lecturer at HMS for her role at the symposium , reiterated how important the rigorous research and evaluation efforts of health care policy faculty and their colleagues at other independent research institutions were to providing the valuable insights necessary for improving health policy. 
 
Sebelius and all the other commentators also stressed the importance of the department as a source of human capital for efforts to improve health care policy, both the faculty members participating in developing and implementing laws and those educating the next generation of leaders in health policy. 
 
As the states try new ways to manage Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, as providers pilot new approaches to coordinated care, as advocates push to incorporate interventions that address the social determinants of health, and as American society continues to search for ways to increase quality, value, affordability and access to care, the need for thoughtful, rigorous health policy research like that produced in the Department of Health Care Policy will continue to be crucial, the speakers agreed.

    <content type="text">, the Federal Trade Commission (âFTCâ) submitted a comment on the Food and Drug Administrationâs (âFDAâsâ) revised draft guidance regarding the process for reviewing 505(q) citizen petitions (âRevised Draft Guidanceâ) .Â  505(q) citizen petitions are petitions that have the potential to delay the approval of pending generic drug or biosimilar marketing applications.Â  The Revised Draft Guidance aims to better protect FDAâs citizen petition process from abuse by pharmaceutical companies that seek to delay generic competition.Â  FDA issued the guidance to help spur competition in the pharmaceutical industry, as part of the Trump Administrationâs war on drug pricing. 

Among other things, the Revised Draft Guidance sets forth the factors that FDA will consider to determine whether the âprimary purposeâ of a petition is to delay generic entry, such that FDA can summarily deny the petition.Â  The Revised Draft Guidance also provides that if FDA determines that a petition was submitted with the âprimary purposeâ of delaying generic entry, FDAâs determination may be memorialized in the agencyâs citizen petition response and FDA will refer the matter to the FTC.Â  
 
In its comment on FDAâs Revised Draft Guidance, the FTC signaled that the agencies are fully aligned toward the goals of increasing competition in the pharmaceutical space, decreasing drug prices, and increasing patient access to necessary therapies.Â  The FTC is an independent law enforcement agency whose mission is to protect consumers by enforcing, among other things, competition laws.Â  As part of its responsibilities, the FTC enforces competition laws in the pharmaceutical industry.Â  
 
In its comment, the FTC voiced support for FDAâs endeavor to protect the citizen petition process from abuse, citing its âlongstanding interest in [preventing] sham petitioning and other abuses of government processes that may inhibit competition,âÂ  as well as its interest in ensuring that consumers have access to generic drugs and biosimilars. The FTC also declared its readiness to collaborate with the FDA on abuse of the citizen petition process, as well as other potentially anticompetitive issues, and cited the two agenciesâ history of working together.Â Â  
 
Given this Administrationâs focus on increasing competition in the pharmaceutical industry as part of its war on drug pricing and the promised collaboration between the FTC and FDA regarding alleged anticompetitive behaviors in the pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical companies should be on alert that the FTC may be on the verge of taking more enforcement actions.</content>

    <content type="text">The nation's health care tab hit $3.5 trillion last year, or $10,739 per person, the government reported. But behind those staggering figures was some fairly good news: 
 
The rate of growth slowed for the second year in a row, according to economic experts at the federal Health and Human Services department. 
 
Health care spending increased by 3.9 percent in 2017, following a 4.8 percent increase in 2016. 
 
Private insurance spending grew more slowly in 2017, and so did Medicaid, while Medicare costs grew at about the same rate. The overall economy grew faster than health spending. 
 
If moderate growth can be maintained, that would make the U.S. health care system more manageable for families, employers and government. 
 
In recent years, insurance coverage expansion under former President Barack Obama and large increases in prescription drug spending had led to faster growth. 
 
But the report found a slight dip in coverage last year and a minimal increase in prescription drug spending, less than half of 1 percent. It was the slowest increase in drug costs since 2012. The spike caused by the introduction of expensive new medications for hepatitis C infection has passed, but it's too soon to tell if a new trend has started. 
 
The per capita spending number of $10,739 is an average across the entire population. In actuality, the sickest patients account for the vast majority of health care costs. Five percent of the population accounts for nearly half of total spending. 
 
The last decade has seen a significant slowdown in the growth of U.S. health care spending, the report found. Annual increases averaged 4.3 percent from 2008-2017, compared with 7.3 percent from 1998-2007. But that doesn't mean the nation has solved its problem of high health care costs. 
 
"For a health sector that now accounts for nearly one-fifth of the US economy, future increases in health care expenditures will likely lead to policy decisions focused on affordability and sustainability," the report concluded. It was published online by the journal Health Affairs.</content>

    <content type="text">Experts in the treatment field applaud the move but say it has taken the LePage administration too long - at the height of the opioids epidemic - to make significant investments in expanding treatment. 

Share 

Read Article 

The LePage administration has approved major increases in reimbursement rates for health professionals to provide medication-assisted treatment to the thousands of Mainers caught up in the epidemic of opioid use disorder. 

The changes, put in place last week, come in the waning days of the eight-year term of Republican Gov. Paul LePage, and years after the opioid crisis began claiming hundreds of lives per year. Maine had 418 drug overdose deaths in 2017 and 180 deaths through the first six months of 2018. 

âConsidering the nature of this epidemic, it took woefully long to do this,â said Eric Haram, a Maine-based consultant who helps health systems implement opioid treatment programs. âThis administration has not been expedient in addressing this problem.â 

The rate increases would pay for therapy, medication and other services for those with opioid use disorder, including Suboxone, which helps curb cravings for opioids. For some services, reimbursement rates have quadrupled. 

The higher payments, combined with Medicaid expansion and a significant increase in the number of doctors and other health professionals trained to prescribe Suboxone, should greatly improve access to treatment, health experts say. According to some estimates, 10,000 to 25,000 Mainers with a substance use disorder will have better access to treatment when Medicaid is expanded by January, when Democratic Gov.-elect Janet Mills replaces LePage. 

Meanwhile, the reimbursement rate is being boosted in the Opioid Health Homes program, which was launched in 2017 by Mary Mayhew, the former Maine health and human services commissioner who is now a federal health official in the Trump administration. 

The Opioid Health Homes program, which aims to provide comprehensive treatment to those with opioid use disorder, was slow to get off the ground, with fewer than 60 patients in the program in February, nearly a year after it started. In October, there were 781 patients in the program, according to state officials, before the reimbursement rates increased last week. 

But with the reimbursement rate increasing from $496 per patient per month to tiered rates of $663 to $2,200 per patient per month, depending on the level of service provided, treatment providers will have a financial incentive to take on more patients. The new rates represent a fair reimbursement for services provided, treatment experts said. 

Malory Shaughnessy, executive director of the Alliance for Addiction and Mental Health Services, a nonprofit group, said sheâs pleased to see the increase and other improvements in the Opioid Health Homes program. But she noted that critics pointed out the flaws in the Opioid Health Homes model in 2017, and state officials were slow to react. 

âWe told them these same things nearly two years ago,â Shaughnessy said. âItâs unfortunate that weâve had 600 to 700 deaths since then, and devastating for the families.â 

Shaughnessy said despite how long itâs taken to act, the changes are a âvery good thing.â The Opioid Health Homes will also do a better job of connecting patients with substance use disorder who also have a co-occurring mental illness to receive mental health treatment, Shaughnessy said, a crucial improvement. 

Emily Spencer, spokeswoman for the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email response to questions that the administration has been improving the Opioid Health Homes program. 

âWe have been working with providers and the legislature to build upon the current OHH model and believe that the program will continue to expand rapidly as more organizations sign on,â Spencer said. 

Haram, the treatment consultant, said without Medicaid expansion, the state would likely have run out of funding to pay for patients, despite the increased reimbursement rates. The Legislature approved $6.7 million for treatment, but Medicaid expansion has the potential to draw down hundreds of millions in federal dollars to pay for 90 percent of the treatment cost for each patient who is in the expansion population. 

About 70,000 Mainers will be eligible to receive Medicaid under expansion. LePage has opposed Medicaid expansion, but voters approved a referendum in 2017 to expand the program. LePage has been fighting implementation of the expansion this year in court, but Mills has said she would expand Medicaid âon day oneâ when she assumes office in January. 

âMedicaid expansion is the more seismic change,â Haram said, referring to access to treatment. 

Gov.-elect Mills has not committed to continuing the Opioid Health Homes model, although she has vowed to give Mainers better access to opioid treatment. 

âPast reports indicate that the Opioid Health Home model developed by the current administration has not achieved the success originally promised, and statistics continue to demonstrate that Maine is not effectively combating this crisis,â said Scott Ogden, a Mills spokeswoman. âAs with any new administration, the governor-elect will review the efficacy of current policies and programs and make adjustments as needed.â 

Katie Fullam Harris, senior vice president of government relations for MaineHealth, the parent company of Maine Medical Center, said the new reimbursement rate is fair, partly because it acknowledges that some patients need more intense treatment than others, and that health care providers need to be paid more for such patients. 

Harris said MaineHealth has been implementing the Opioid Health Homes program into its primary care practices over the past two years. She said with better reimbursement rates and more flexibility by the state in how the program can be run, it is set to take off. She said she would prefer tweaks by the Mills administration rather than an overhaul. 

âWeâve invested a lot into this system,â Harris said. âI would be concerned if we would suddenly pull the rug out.â

    <content type="text">Health-system pharmacies could see more opportunities for revenue recovery in 2019, as well as increased transparency and access to care for patients. At the 2018 American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) Midyear Clinical Meeting  in Anaheim, CA, a group of advisors from McKesson RxO shared 5 trends they believe will help shape the industry in 2019.

Increasing Reliance on Technology in Pharmacy: Predictions for 2019 
'Next-door health care' use will rise. 
Patients want health care closer to them, and health-system pharmacies are working to expand services into retail sites and medical clinics, through regional and local partnerships with providers. In an interview with Pharmacy Times at ASHP Midyear, Mark Eastham, Senior Vice President of McKesson RxO, said health systems also are beginning to partner with large employers to serve their workforces. 

âThese employees that are living in these neighborhoods can go to a local clinic and be able to get the services that theyâre looking for, instead of having to drive a long way away,â said Eastham. 

In addition to having easier access to care for patients, health systems also benefit by having these programs capture information on patients and have the ability to track their care. âClinically, theyâre being treated well, and we know that theyâre being adherent to their medication,â Eastham said. 

There will be an increased focus on 340B. 
Debate is ongoing in Congress over the 340B Drug Pricing Program, raising focus on its performance and compliance for health-system leaders. According to McKesson RxO data, tougher audits and revised guidance for self-disclosure and corrective action plans by the Health Resources and Services Administration has also increased attention. 

In an effort to assist pharmacy leaders, and other industry professionals, ASHP and McKesson partnered to develop a handbook that serves as a practical guide to the 340B program. 

Tracking and managing data will optimize outcomes.Â  
Data is the cornerstone of treating patients, Eastham said, and sharing that information is critical. âIt comes from many different providers in many different areas of that health system,â he said. 

The challenge with data, however, it that there is so much of it out there, Eastham added. âHealth systems are using disparate systems, and so theyâre trying to make sure they can communicate with each other,â Eastham explained. 

Pharmacy directors also are facing increasing pressure to utilize data and analytics for optimizing health system pharmacy growth. Tracking and monitoring drug spend and utilization will continue to be top priorities in the coming year, according to McKesson RxO advisors. 

Public policy will drive greater transparency. 
Providers and consumers are looking for more transparency. However, privacy rights and data security pose challenges. Keeping data secure, but also sharing it with appropriate parties is the goal. 

âConsumers are demanding transparency. They want to be able to access their own data. They want to see that data,â said Eastham. 

One current issue receiving attention is transparency with drug cost. Having patients understand the cost of medication could be helped by pricing being included in television advertising for drug products. 

âTransparency in pricing is very important. I think itâs a good thing,â said Eastham. âAt the same time, though, we need to make sure that providers are diagnosing and prescribing the right medications for the right patients.â 

Specialty drug spending will grow. 
The specialty drug market saw a 16% growth rate in 2018, according to a recent report. Although restricted access continues to be a challenge for health systems in the United States, specialty pharmacies can still generate significant revenue, according to McKesson RxO data. 

Eastham said more and more specialty drugs are coming onto the market. 

âWhat's important about them is they target certain disease states,â he said. 

According to Eastham, specialty drug spend will continue to grow.</content>

    <content type="text">National healthcare spending grew at a rate of 3.9 percent to $3.5 trillion in 2017, according to a prepared statement from CMS. That number is down from 2016, when spending grew 4.8 percent. 

Healthcare spending is also growing at a slower rate than the overall economy, which grew at a rate of 4.2 percent in 2017. 
 
According to the report, spending slowed down in 2017 for three significant goods and services categories: hospital spending, physician and clinical services spending and retail prescription drug spending. 
 
Private health insurance, Medicaid and out-of-pocket spending also slowed down that year, though Medicare spending was approximately the same.

    <content type="text">In 2010, 2013 and 2017, there were three major floods in the Town of Cobourg, Ontario. The most recent saw 50- to 70-mm of rainfall across a three-day span. Some streets had to be closed, rendered unusable by the flooding. 
 
Cobourg was proactive in advance of these floods, conducting inflow and infiltration flow studies in 2005 and 2006. The studies aimed to determine how much sewer capacity their manholes were costing them annually. The low-lying areas located near creeks, swamps and other waterways â the areas that were targeted in their flow studies â were the most strongly impacted. 
 
RELATED: Access Denied: Manhole Rehab and the Fight Against I/I 
 
The studies gave the Town an idea of the manholes that needed to be repaired, relined or replaced entirely. Town leaders conducted tests in different inflow and infiltration-sensitive areas in the Town and found two manhole locations in particular, located in swamp areas, that were perfect candidates for determining how much inflow and infiltration comes through and around their frame and covers. 
 
Hereâs what they were able to resolve: the only thing preventing inflow and infiltration were the dead leaves around the existing manhole frame and covers and in the holes of the covers themselves. Because surface inflow is easier and less expensive to remedy than infiltration that occurs underground through pipe joint, crack leaks, and root intrusions, the flow study was an excellent opportunity for the town 
 
The Town discovered another issue through these flow studies: as the season transitions from winter to spring, meltwater significantly increases the amount of inflow and infiltration in their sewer systems. 
When the weather gets warmer towards the end of winter, the snow and ice melt, causing an influx in groundwater that needs to go somewhere. Because snow is often plowed into the middle of cul-de-sacs, these were some of the areas most affected by meltwater. 
 
Although some meltwater will find its way into storm systems, some will inevitably run into the sanitary sewer systems throughout the municipality. Once this happens, the extraneous water will then be sent to the wastewater treatment plant. Each treatment plant has a rated capacity for how many cubic metres it is able to treat per day, and there are times when these amounts become too high and exceed the plantâs peak flow rate. 
 
Jennifer Leno, Environmental Technician with the Town of Cobourg, stated that the amount of wastewater that is treated on any given day can vary dramatically depending on the environment and weather conditions â anywhere from 9,000 cubic metres per day on average up to 40,000 per day during a significant rain event. Losing this much sewer capacity can be very expensive for a municipality and affect future development. 
 
RELATED: Cost-Effective I/I Reduction: âHub Cityâ Concentrates on Manhole Renewal to Ease Pressure on Sewer Network 
 Old Adage Needs an Update  
Various water treatment methods, such as heating water to purify it, date as far back as the ancient Greeks in 2000 BC. There is an old adage dating back to the 1950s, however, which is more relevant to our situation today: The solution to pollution is dilution. 
 
The thought process back then was that the best way to handle sewage (as well as other forms of pollution such as air) was to dilute it somehow. In the case of sewage, this was often done by running the sanitary sewer lines into the clean waterways within any given municipality. Thatâs one of the reasons there are so many manhole frames and covers located next to waterways. It was determined over time, and with the exponential growth of communities, that this was not an effective solution. Municipalities then began directing these sewer lines to the water treatment plants instead of directly into the waterways. 
 
Although water treatment plants date as far back as the 1800s, the thought process was not the same as it is today with regards to keeping our waterways free of sewage and other harmful substances. These manhole locations next to waterways oftentimes become covered in water as the water level rises due to excessive rainfall and meltwater. Cobourgâs leaders realized that something needed to be done to prevent these inflow and infiltration compromised locations from generating an excessive treatment cost. 
 
The Public Works Department for the Town of Cobourg, Ontario, is in the process of replacing 150 manholes in its floodplain area. 
 The Solution  
The types of inflow and infiltration sensitive areas described above can be addressed through the use of watertight manhole frame and covers. The Lifespan System from Hamilton Kent was one of the solutions that the town of Cobourg used to stop surface level inflow in these areas. 
 
The Lifespan System is a watertight, corrosion-proof, non-conductive locking rubber manhole frame and cover system that prevents rain-derived inflow from entering sanitary sewers through the top of the manhole. 
 
Aside from robbing a sanitary system of its capacity, infiltration can also cause erosion of fine materials from the soil envelope, which in turn leads to voids in the surrounding backfill and possible pavement degradation. A key advantage of a watertight manhole system is that it dramatically lessens the effects of pavement pancaking and deterioration since infiltration is drastically reduced around the frame and cover. âThe pavement is still pristine around the Lifespan System locations installed in-road after nearly 5 years,â says Leno. 
 
RELATED: The Keys to the Growth of the Manhole Rehabilitation Market 
 
The Town of Cobourg is planning to install 25 watertight manhole solutions each year over the next several years until they have finished replacing approximately 150 manholes that are in the Townâs floodplain areas and near the townâs four creeks. 
 
Because Cobourg officials found a way to reduce the amount of inflow and infiltration coming through manholes, lost sewer capacity has been restored, development has progressed and the underground rehabilitation of the wastewater collection system can be addressed at a more reasonable and financially feasible rate. Construction or expansion of wastewater collection systems could be done years â and potentially decades â in the future.

The shift to value-based care poses both risks and new opportunities for ASCs in the area of inventory management, according to Johnson &amp; Johnson Health Care Systems' Ruben Taborda, senior director of supply chain customer solutions. 
 
Here is a tip Mr. Taborda shared with Becker's ASC Review: 
 
"As the shift to value-based care continues, there is an increased focus on value, from clinical outcomes and experience throughout the patient journey pre- and postsurgery, to efficient supply management. These elements are even more important in the context of outpatient surgery. A key opportunity related to inventory management is vulnerability in inventory and supply ordering protocols, specifically an aversion to investments in advanced [enterprise resource planning] systems and a reliance on one central staff member for inventory and supply orders. We are working with ASCs to help identify risk areas and manage these opportunities."

    <content type="text">Itâs time for a reality check when it comes to universal healthcare. Usually, that means those with an idealistic vision of equity and justice must give it up in favor a more achievable program. Â But in this case, the reality of whatâs achievable exceeds the low expectations and compromises that have for decades limited the healthcare reform debate. 

Providing this reality check on how we turn from our wasteful healthcare industry to a system of guaranteed healthcare is a new study by the PERI at UMass âAmherst whose lead author is noted labor economist Robert Pollin. Through a comprehensive literature review and rigorous empirical work, the study show the average worker getting a 9% raise, and businesses saving 8% of payroll, as health outcomes improve, costs go lower and the economy benefits. 
 
Through a comprehensive literature review and rigorous empirical work, the study show the average worker getting a 9% raise, and businesses saving 8% of payroll, as health outcomes improve, costs go lower and the economy benefits. 
 
Contrary to the doom and gloom of the latest healthcare spending numbers for the US â $3.5 Trillion overall, $10,739 per person, now exceeding 18% of GDP while providing worse outcomes, lower quality and shorter life expectancy than any other industrialized country â the Pollin study shows we can guarantee healthcare to all US residents by improving Medicare, and expanding it to everybody. 
 
The study answers the proverbial question, âbut how do we pay for it?â By utilizing the existing public sources that account for 60% of current financing, eliminating commercial insurance premiums, co-pays and deductibles, and replacing those with a combination of payroll taxes substantially less than employers are paying now, an upper income tax that makes the wealthy pay their fair share, and a sales tax on non-necessities. 
 
Paying for the new improved healthcare system is easier because of the cost savings achieved by S 1804, Senator Sanders Medicare for All Act of 2017, which the study reviewed. S 1804 eliminates administrative waste and inefficiencies âthe claims denial, pre-authorizations, marketing costs, and profits of the insurance companies, and improves service delivery. Â Through negotiations modeled on other countries and the VA, the bill lowers prescription drug prices by an estimated 40%, and sets rates for providers based on Medicare, saving an additional 3% overall. 
 
The study shows that as we cover everybody with decent benefits, costs will likely rise about 12%. This is not surprising. People will seek care once barriers are eliminated since there are 28 million uninsured, and 30% of people with insurance coverage find themselves underinsured (nearly half of Americans went without some treatment in the last year because they couldnât afford it according). Â But that cost increase is more than offset by the savings achieved under âsingle-payerâ financing. 
 
Itâs important to note that these savings are not available under a multi-payer system, under a system of Medicare buy-in, or via proposals that keep tens of millions of workers in commercial insurance plans. Â In such schemes, the administration costs for providers do not substantially decrease; 20% of the tax subsidies to buy insurance are wasted on overhead, marketing and profits; the leverage to set rates is not as strong; and individual purchase (âbuy-inâ) undermines the social insurance model that spreads costs. Nor can we expect to just cut prescription drug prices and leave insurance company rates and hospital charges untouched. 
 
A key policy issue is the transition to an improved Medicare for All system. For seniors increasingly burdened by co-pays, or restricted access to providers through Medicare Advantage plans, improvement is urgent. Â Medicare for All in the first year means the inclusion of dental, vision and hearing, as well as expanded long term care benefits, and no more co-pays. (Dr. Pollin promotes a one year transition, the bill provides for four year phase-in.) 
 
Most important is to transition those people working in the health insurance industry, and in the administration of health services, out of those jobs in a secure way. The Pollin study addresses the âjust transitionâ for workers through an income guarantee, complete protection of pension benefits and job training. The estimated cost to the system is $30 billion per year for two years, again reflecting the reality of what it takes to create a restructured health system. 
 
That restructuring cannot happen quickly enough as we head toward a future of fragmented insurance markets, corporate healthcare silos like the CVS-AETNA company, âon your own your own careâ via telemedicine, and diminished safety net programs. 
 
Our health is not a commodity to profit from, nor is it a welfare program to be minimized or privatized. The alternative, as the PERI study shows so clearly, is a just, equitable financing system of guaranteed healthcare for all. Yes, we can get more and pay less. 
 
The biggest change that would come is not financial: we can end the anxiety over healthcare. We can win peace of mind!</content>

The consumer demand for accessible and affordable care is driving patients to specialty clinics and surgery centers, according to Alejandro Badia, MD, the founder and CMO of Doral, Fla.-based OrthoNOW. 
 
Dr. Badia shared three insights on surgery in ASCs: 
 
1. He said is a proponent of "de-hospitalization" through bypassing more expensive healthcare institutions in favor of outpatient surgical centers and clinics. 
 
2. In an article by Dr. Badia published in Miami Medicine, he cited a KNG Health Consulting study that found moving procedures into ASCs from hospitals decreased the cost of treatment. 
 
3. "Too often, patients with orthopedic injuries or other problems would be sent by their physician to a hospital emergency room for expensive care and unnecessary diagnostic tests before being ultimately referred to me for help," Dr. Badia said, citing a study published in the Journal of Bone &amp; Joint Surgery that found ASCs are cost efficient options for patients through their small size, specialization of care and engagement with perioperative process improvement.

Lone Star Family Health Center relocates Willis clinic, partners with Kroger 
  
 Back to Gallery 
       
Lone Star Family Health Center is relocating its fastest growing satellite clinic in Willis and partnering with the Kroger Marketplace Pharmacy to address health care access and to help patients with prescription costs. 
 
The health center announced that it is moving to suite 140 at the Kroger Marketplace at 9516 West FM 1097 in Willis because it has outgrown the current building located at 201 Lincoln Ridge and needed more space for its patients. The current building opened in 2015 with a part time physician as a temporary facility funded by a Health and Resources Service Administration grant. The grant gave a 120-day timeframe to secure land and open the facility. 
 
The new 3,850 square foot space will provide a larger waiting area, more exam rooms, and additional space to add a medical provider without the need to build a new building or pay for the associated expenses such as for the design and construction. It will be open starting on Monday for appointments. It is being funded through the same HRSA grant and cost savings will go toward increasing patient services and care. 
 
âBecause of the population growth across Montgomery County and the anticipated additional growth coming in Willis due to The Woodlands Hills development our clinic has seen a fast patient increase,â Lone Star Family Health Center CEO Karen Harwell said in an email. âThe new space gives us 1,200 more square feet and the ability to add a provider going forward.â 
 
LSFHC reported its patient base in Willis was 3,618 individual patients in 2017 with 8,604 visits. Over the past four months, since August 1, 2018, LSFHC has seen 1,988 patients over 3,057 visits. In 2017, across all clinics, LSFHC saw 30,000 patients through approximately 98,000 visits. LSFHC also has clinics in Conroe, which is its main location, and satellite clinics in Spring, and Grangerland. 
 
The original plan was to build a permanent building at the current site of the temporary building, but when the already built out medical office space became available the Board of Directors made the decision to move rather than rebuild because it allowed quick expansion without taking on debt and the option of growth more quickly. 
 
âWe were able to acquire much of the equipment we would need to expand from the past tenant,â Harwell said. âAll of that means savings in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and relieved us of the need to acquire a loan to build a clinic. Those saved funds will allow us to increase services to patients faster.â 
 
The clinic currently has a full time physician and nurse practitioner. It offers the full scope of family medicine including womenâs health, menâs health, geriatric care, pediatrics, sports and work physicals, child and adult vaccinations, diabetes management, and other services for preventative care. LSFHC can also process eligibility applications for both state and federal programs it offers such as its sliding fee scale discount program. A mental health counselor will resume services at the new location as well. 
 
While Harwell said LSFHC will not have the space to park the mobile dental bus at the new location, it is actively looking and hopes to soon find a solution for dental offices. 
 
âUntil then, patients needing dental care will need to access that through our Conroe facility,â she said. 
 
LSFHC also recently partnered with the Kroger Pharmacy to offer discounted prescription prices to patients of its Willis Clinic without needing to drive to the Conroe Clinic. As a Federally Qualified Health Center, Harwell said LSFHC has a nonprofit pharmacy that offers all prescriptions written by its doctors at steep discounts. The discounts apply to any patient, insured or uninsured who sees a LSFHC provider. Hamlin said the new space will bring the Willis Clinic more closely in line with LSFHCâs belief that those without insurance coverage should have access to the same level facility as their insured counterparts. More exams rooms will also help patients get to their rooms more quickly and therefore see a provider more quickly. 
 
âPrior to our partnership with Kroger patients of our Willis clinic would have had to drive to Conroe to receive this benefit, but they can now access it locally,â Harwell said. âBecause many of our patients face a choice between prescriptions and necessities like food and gas money, this is a huge benefit. The new location within the Kroger Marketplace only makes access to those prescriptions easier.â 
 
The Willis patient base includes patients from the north edge of Conroe, Willis, and many from Huntsville. About 17 percent of the patients are uninsured with an additional 31 percent on Medicaid and 21 percent getting CHIP or other public coverage. LSFHC stated 66 percent of its patients are at or below the federal poverty line. 
 
âMany of the rest are what would be considered the working poor, making enough to qualify above public assistance but little enough that medical care is unaffordable,â Harwell stated. âThis is where discounted services and prescriptions make a big difference.â

    <content type="text">Investing in the life sciences industry without an understanding of the key regulatory factors that could determine a productâs success or failure could cost you millions of dollars.

As the industry readies itself for the 2019 edition of the annual pilgrimage to the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, our market-leading Global Regulatory Team has prepared a series of updates covering the following topic areas that we hope will help guide your 2019 investment decisions.

Drug pricing and reimbursement Regulatory changes in Europe Digital health and medtech Data privacy and cybersecurity Value-based purchasing Cell and gene therapies European regulatory changes elevate life sciences market uncertainty 

In the European Union, the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries are required to constantly adapt to new regulatory developments. Since April 2017, the adoption of medical devices regulations and the EU , the aftermath of Britainâs vote to exit the EU, and the debate over drug pricing have caused challenges for life sciences companies in the EU as they attempt to identify and comply with applicable laws.

Medical devices regulations to establish uniform EU framework

In April 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulations (MDR) and the In Vitro diagnostic medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) were adopted, which will repeal and replace the EU Medical Devices Directives. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, the MDR and IVDR will be directly applicable in the EU member states. The MDR and IVDR are, among other things, intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. They will have significant implications on the way medical devices are currently regulated in the EU. The MDR will be applicable as of May 26, 2020, and the IVDR as of May 26, 2022.

Brexit prompts industry restructuring

With the advent of Brexit, the United Kingdom is set to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) headquarters is moving from London to Amsterdam. For pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, Brexit has prompted the transfer of several regulatory activities from the UK to other EU member states, including marketing authorizations, batch release, and the Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance. In addition, many life sciences companies are restructuring their European distribution models; in particular, the Netherlands and Ireland appear to have attracted interest from life sciences companies. While the Brexit vote raised several questions that remain unanswered, EU authorities have recommended that the life sciences industry prepare for a no-deal Brexit.

EU reacts to claims of excessive drug prices

The industry is also faced with the increasing complexities and challenges related to pricing and reimbursement mechanisms, including the increasing use of health technology assessments by the pricing and reimbursement authorities. Although pricing and reimbursement are dealt with at a national EU member state level, there is increased collaboration between the member states. For example, in the "BeNeLuxA" initiative, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, and Ireland have joined forces to exchange information and conduct joint price negotiations for expensive medicines. In 2018, the European Commission issued a much-debated legislative proposal for joint health technology assessment (HTA) among the EU member states.

The debate about drug pricing and perceived excessive pricing has prompted political debate in some EU member states about possibilities to apply cheaper alternatives such as off-label use, pharmacy compounding, personal import from outside the EU, or even compulsory patent licenses. However, some of these suggestions may be questionable from an EU pharmaceutical regulatory law perspective, which requires a marketing authorization based on an appropriate data package in order to place a medicinal product on the market. The antitrust and competition authorities are also investigating potential cases of excessive drug pricing.

Exclusivity rights: court rulings and European Commission assessment

In the area of regulatory data exclusivity and orphan exclusivity in the EU, several court decisions in 2018 â both by the Court of Justice of the European Union and by national courts in the UK and the Netherlands â confirmed the exclusivity rights for innovator pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In 2018-2019, the European Commission is conducting an assessment of the EU regulatory regimes for orphan medicinal products and for pediatric medicinal products. In May 2018, two extensive study reports were published on the economic and legal implications of supplementary protection certificates (SPCs â which extend a patent) and of pharmaceutical incentives such as regulatory data exclusivity and orphan exclusivity. Also in May 2018, the European Commission published a legislative proposal to introduce an SPC manufacturing waiver. The waiver would allow generics and biosimilars manufacturers to manufacture generics/biosimilars in the EU intended for export to outside the EU while an SPC is still in force.

Recent regulatory approvals of medicinal products in the areas of immuno-oncology and gene therapy have attracted attention not only medically and commercially but also contribute to development of regulatory guidance in these areas.

Data privacy affected by GPDR

In May 2018, the GDPR created new challenges for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. As a consequence of the GDPR, companies must completely re-assess the way they collect, process, and transfer personal data as part of their activities. As an illustration, the GDPR requires a number of changes to the informed consent forms used by companies to collect the consent of patients for participating to clinical studies.

Increased focus on Sunshine rules and other compliance topics

Last, health care compliance continues to be an important area of focus in the EU. Increasingly, EU member states implement transparency requirements, or so-called âSunshine rules,â on disclosing transfers of value made to health care professionals, institutions, and patients organizations. The competent authorities appear to take a relatively active approach in investigations and enforcement. Investigations have focused on excessive payments to health care professionals, pre-approval promotion, and direct-to-consumer promotion of prescription-only medicines.

    <content type="text">Today, people with chronic conditions account for 84% of nationwide healthcare spending, and one in four American adults have two or more chronic conditions. Those numbers, and the costs associated, are going up. 
 
Existing remote patient monitoring systems, or RPMs, have created opportunities for physicians to reduce costs while improving care. Proactive interventions, continuous feedback loops and better patient self-management becuase of RPMs are having a positive impact. 
 
New systems of remote monitoring are emerging that promise to have an even greater impact of patient care are emerging. Use of data and related AI-driven components are the key distinguishing features of these new RPMs. 
 
At a roundtable during the 2018 Connected Health Conference, leaders and stakeholders from all corners of the healthcare world â including patients, payers, providers, and technologists â discussed how to overcome barriers to the deployment of remote monitoring programs. The group identified five key tactics for operationally deploying data-driven remote care. 
 
1) Make the data actionable 
 As one Telehealth Director put it, ââData is great, but at the end of the dayÂ physicians are too busy, and the workflow must be as seamless as possible for them to embrace something new.â 
 
 
2) Build an integrated program â for patients and providers 
 Providers today are overburdened with high volumes of patients and difficult technical systems, so integrating a new program of care can be a challenge. Likewise, patients face barriers to remote monitoring when it requires behavior that doesnât align with their daily routines. Integrating data from devices patients are already using â directly into the EHR and existing clinical workflows â is key for adoption. 
 
3) Prepare organizations for change 
 Another hurdle for these new systems is the failure to actively managing the change to a new system. âWhen really clear success criteria arenât defined up front, it makes the process really long and it becomes hard to feel like youâreÂ accomplishing anything,â said Martin Entwistle, CEO &amp; President, Ares Health Systems. 
 
4) Take advantage of existing financial support 
 There are new CPT codes to support remote monitoring initiatives demonstrate this. Specifically, three new codes were introduced with the 2019 Physician Fee Schedule Rule that take a significant leap in offering reimbursement for remote monitoring programs. 
 
 
âNew reimbursements from CMS are promising in their support for the use of digital health technologies and patient-generated health data in remote monitoring programs,â said, Drew Schiller, CEO, Validic 
 
5) Understand the value of remote monitoring 
 If managed well, and proper expectations are set up front, remote monitoring holds major benefits for doctors and their patients. It affords physicians the ability to practice at the top of their license, providing care more efficiently to the people who need their attention most. 
 
 
While an RPM is not for all patients, but for those who are willing to use it, the technology can help them to see themselves in a new way. Patient Advocate Steve Van said, âThe data helped me look at myself in a way that was different, and it became the language by which my doctor and I communicated. We now have true, meaningful dialogue.â 
 
At a time when higher volumes of patients require more comprehensive care â especially to manage chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension â and the industry is at the crossroads of fee-for-service versus value-based care, the roundtable participants agreed that, if implemented well, the latest data- and intelligence-driven systems opportunities to improve health outcomes for patients while providing more meaningful care.

More uninsured or underinsured New Yorkers living with HIV will be eligible for financial assistance with their healthcare costs beginning in 2019, according to new regulations announced by Governor Andrew Cuomo. 
 
The State Department of Health is set to loosen eligibility requirements that are currently too strict for many HIV-positive people who fall just outside of the range of coverage for the HIV Uninsured Care Programs (HUCP). The HUCP includes a variety of components of the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), which covers the cost of health insurance premiums, HIV medications, home care services, and more. 
 
Existing rules stipulate that recipients are only eligible if they do not have more than $25,000 in liquid assets and their household income does not exceed 435 percent of the federal poverty level. ( The current federal poverty level is $12,140 for individuals and $16,460 for a family of two.) The new rules will increase the household income requirement to 500 percent of the federal poverty level, and there will no longer be a cap on resources on hand. 
 
âExpanding access to care is crucial to ending the epidemic, and the new regulations will ensure that people get the help they need,â Dr. Howard Zucker, the stateâs commissioner of health, said in a written statement. âTreatment is only possible after a diagnosis, so I encourage everyone to get tested and know their status.â 
 
The proposed changes, which are a part of Cuomoâs âEnding the Epidemicâ initiative to lower the amount of new HIV infections by the end of 2020 to no more than 750 â a level at which experts estimate the epidemic can no longer sustain itself â are slated to go into effect early next year. 
 
Additionally, the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute is implementing a new policy that will focus on speeding up the time an individual begins HIV treatment upon diagnosis. The policy calls for initiation of treatment between three and 30 days of diagnosis. 
 
The state has reached new milestones in recent years in its fight to eradicate HIV. New diagnoses have dropped by 20 percent since 2014 and dipped to an all-time low of 2,769 last year. New diagnoses per 100,000 people have decreased by 42 percent among Hispanic people and 52 percent among black people during that period. According to statistics from the cityâs Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the number of new infections â a measure distinct from new diagnoses â continued its decline from 2016 to 2017, with reductions seen in all measured demographic subgroups except Latino gay and bisexual men.

CMS has just touted the National Health Expenditure growth of 3.9% for 2017 is at historic low levels, with the Office of the Actuary stating âprior to the coverage expansions and temporary high growth in prescription drug spending during that same period, health spending was growing at historically low rates. In 2017, health care spending growth returned to these lower rates and the health spending share of GDP stabilized for the first time since 2013.âÂ  
 
Meanwhile, The Commonwealth Fund paints a different picture from another perspective, and has just released a 21-page DataBrief: The Cost of Employer Insurance Is a Growing Burden for Middle Income Families , with lead author Sara Collins commenting âThe cost of employer health insurance premiums and deductibles continues to outpace growth in workersâ wages. This is concerning, because it may put both coverage and health care out of reach for people who need it most â people with low incomes and those with health problems. Policies that would reduce health care burdens on employees include fixing the Affordable Care Actâs family coverage glitch, requiring employers to exclude some services from the deductible, and increasing the required minimum value of employer plans.âÂ  
 
The Commonwealth Fund tells us their study uses âthe latest data from the federal Medical Expenditure Panel SurveyâInsurance Component (MEPSâIC) to examine trends in employer premiums at the state level to see how much workers and their families are paying for their employer coverage in terms of premium contributions and deductibles. We examine the size of these costs relative to income for those at the midrange of income distribution.âÂ  
 
Hereâs a dozen key findings:Â  
  Average employee premium contributions for single and family plans amounted to nearly 7 percent of U.S. median income in 2017, up from 5 percent in 2008.Â   In 11 states (Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas), premium contributions were 8 percent of median income or more, with a high of 10.2 percent in Louisiana.  Premium and deductible costs amounted to nearly 12 percent of median income in 2017. Added together, the total cost of premiums to workers and potential spending on deductibles for both single and family policies climbed to $7,240 a year in 2017.Â   This combined cost ranged from a low of $4,664 in Hawaii to a high of more than $8,000 in eight states (Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia).Â   In two states, Mississippi and Louisiana, these combined costs rose to 15 percent or more of median income.  Premiums for employer health plans rose sharply in nearly every state in 2017. After climbing modestly between 2011 and 2016, overall premiums for employer health plans (employer and employee share) grew more sharply in 2017, by 4.4 percent for single plans and 5.5 percent for family plans.Â   Annual single person premiums rose above $7,000 in eight states (Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Wyoming) and family premiums were $20,000 or higher in seven states (Alaska, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, West Virginia, Wyoming) and the District of Columbia.Â   Average premiums for families increased overall in 44 states and the District of Columbia.  As employer premiums have risen, so have workersâ contributions. Between 2016 and 2017, employee premium contributions rose by 6.8 percent to $1,415 for single-person plans and by 5.3 percent to $5,218 for family plans.  Contributions for single plans increased in 32 states, ranging from a low of $675 in Hawaii to a high of $1,747 in Massachusetts.Â   Contributions for family plans rose in 35 states and the District of Columbia, with the lowest increase in Michigan ($3,646) and the highest in Delaware ($6,533).  The average deductible for single policies rose to $1,808 in 2017, a 6.6 percent increase. Average deductibles rose in 35 states and the District of Columbia, ranging from a low of $863 in Hawaii to a high of about $2,300 in Maine and New Hampshire.</content>

    <content type="text">, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) published 83 Fed. Reg. 62152, which proposes changes to Medicare Part D (prescription drug benefit) and drug plans offered by Medicare Advantage (managed care) in an effort to reduce out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries. The proposed rule is part of the Trump Administrationâs four part strategy to effectuate its âBlueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs,â published in May 2018. The Administrationâs strategy aims to lower prescription drug costs for patients with a mixed approach of âimproved competition, better negotiation, incentives for lower list prices, and lowering out-of-pocket costs.â[1]

Increased Flexibility to Manage Protected Classes 

Medicare Part D plans must cover two or more medications in a given therapeutic class. The protected class policy requires that Medicare Part D plan sponsors cover all or substantially all drugs for six specially designated therapy classes. Further, sponsors must list the medications in all six designated therapy classes on their formularies. The designated therapy classes include: (1) antidepressants; (2) antipsychotics; (3) anticonvulsants; (4) immunosuppressants for treatment of transplant rejection; (5) antiretrovirals; and (6) antineoplastics. This protected class policy was implemented when Part D began 12 years ago to provide medication access to beneficiaries while the program was in its early stages. As Part D plans have matured, CMS is now proposing to reduce these protections and increase plan sponsor flexibility with formulary design and negotiating prices for drugs. Specifically, the proposal includes three exceptions to the protected class policy.

First, the proposal would allow Part D sponsors to use prior authorization and step therapy for protected class drugs. In addition, CMS âwould also allow indication-based formulary design and utilization management for protected class drugs.â[2] Indication-based formulary design would permit Part D sponsors to create drug formularies based on the disease indications they themselves choose, rather than having to cover all indications approved by the FDA. Part D plan formularies designed under this exception would continue to be subject to CMSâs annual formulary review and approval process. Second, Part D plan sponsors could exclude from their formularies any protected class drugs that are updated formulations of existing protected class drugs, regardless of whether the old formulation remains available. The third exception would allow Part D sponsors to exclude protected a class drug from its formulary when the price for such drug rises faster than inflation over a designated period. Increased Transparency Regarding Lower-cost Therapy Alternatives 

Under the new proposal, Part D plan sponsors would be required to implement a Real-Time Benefit Tool by January 1, 2020. This system alerts prescribers about lower-cost therapy alternatives for their patient under the patientâs plan benefits.

In addition, CMS would require that the Part D plan sponsorsâ Explanation of Benefits sent to beneficiaries include information regarding drug pricing and identify cost effective therapeutic alternatives. CMS anticipates that providing such information to beneficiaries will enable them to lower their out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions.

Gag Clause Prohibition 

In October 2018, Congress passed the âKnow the Lowest Price Act of 2018â (P.L. 115- 262). Beginning on January 1, 2020, this law will prohibit Part D sponsors from restricting pharmacies from discussing the cash price of a drug with patients when it is less than the amount of the his or her insurance copayment for the medication. CMSâ current proposal would align the Part D regulations with the 2020 gag clause prohibition.

Implications 

On November 29, 2018, the Partnership for Part D Access (the Partnership) released a study, which casts doubt on the beneficial effects of the new proposal. Specifically, the study concluded that âMedicareâs existing protected classes policy is working as intended for Medicare beneficiaries with some of the most complex health conditions: cancer, HIV, transplant recipients, epilepsy, and mental illness among others.â[3] Further, the study demonstrated the current system controls costs in a variety of ways such as requiring copayments for expensive brand drugs and promoting generic versions of drugs. As such, changes to the current system motivated solely by overall cost could be detrimental for certain high risk patients who are receiving treatments including cancer, HIV, and kidney transplants that require expensive drugs with high copayments and no generic options.

There is further concern that reducing the protections of certain medications will ultimately lead to their exclusion from Part D plan formularies. Such exclusion would ultimately render drugs inaccessible to Part D beneficiaries and could leave patients in a position where they are unable to afford the medications on which they rely. CMS is accepting comments through January 25, 2019.

Looking Forward 

As a part of its effort to lower prescription drug costs, CMS is also considering a proposal that would ârequire that the price a beneficiary pays at the pharmacy counter reflects the lowest possible cost.â[4] This proposal could eliminate various types of rebates and back-end negotiations strategies. CMS predicts that this requirement could be implemented as soon as 2020 and that it would save beneficiaries between 12 and 15 billion dollars over the next decade.

    <content type="text">Recently, 6 European organizations appealedÂ a European Patent Office (EPO) decision to uphold Gilead Scienceâs patent on the hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir, sold as Sovaldi. 
Recently, 6 European organizations appealed a European Patent Office (EPO) decision to uphold Gilead Scienceâs patent on the hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir, sold as Sovaldi. 
In March 2017, organizations from 17 European countries filed a challenge against Gileadâs patent that covers the base compound found in sofosbuvir, alleging that it lacked inventiveness. Despite the accusations, the EPO decided to uphold Gileadâs patent in September 2018, maintaining its exclusivity in the marketplace. 

âThe EPO is being too lenient with pharmaceutical corporations, giving them a free pass. There needs to be much greater scrutiny in Europe when it comes to determining whether pharmaceutical corporations deserve patents or not; otherwise, unmerited monopolies will continue to result in out-of-control drug prices,â said Olivier Maguet of MÃ©decins du Monde. 

MÃ©dicins du Monde, Medicines Sans FrontiÃ©res (Doctors Without Borders), AIDES, Access to Medicines Ireland, Praksis, and Salud por Derecho appealed based on the claim that the EPO should revoke Gileadâs patent because it âdoes not meet the requirements to be a patentable invention from a legal or scientific perspective.â 

To date, Gilead has maintained a monopoly on the hepatitis C drug market in Europe, which has, in turn, enabled the company to charge âexcessiveâ prices for the drug. 

âIn some European countries, Gilead charges as much as 43,000 euros for a 12-week treatment course, when generic versions of the same course can be purchased for less than 75 euros outside of Europe,â read the press release. 

In the United States, the drug launched in 2013 at $1000 per pill, or $84,000 for a 12-week standard treatment course. In the last 5 years, Gilead has made more than $58 billion from sales of sofosbuvir alone; however, earnings have been declining as of late due to increased competition in the US market. 

âThe excessive prices Gilead is charging for sofosbuvir have kept this breakthrough medicine away from millions of people with hepatitis C in Europe and around the world. What is the point of medical innovation if people and health systems cannot afford the products coming out of it?â said Gaelle Krikorian, head of policy at Medicines Sans FrontiÃ©res Access Campaign, in a statement .</content>

Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services 
330 C Street, S.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20416 
 
Dear Secretary Azar, 
 
During a meeting on October 17, 2018, President Trump directed you and other members of his Cabinet to cut their department budgets by 5 percent in fiscal year (FY) 2019.Â  With a national debt of more than $21 trillion and the budget deficit soaring to its highest level since 2012, President Trumpâs initiative will help to improve fiscal responsibility. 
 
Since 1993, Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) has annually publishedÂ  Prime Cuts , a comprehensive account of options the federal government possesses to reduce waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.Â  The 2018 edition has 636 recommendations that would save $429.8 billion in the first year and $3.1 trillion over five years.Â  Since CAGW was established in 1984 following the release of the Grace Commission report under President Reagan, the implementation of recommendations similar to those inÂ  Prime CutsÂ  has helped save taxpayers $1.8 trillion. 
 
I urge you to consider the following recommendations for President Trumpâs 5 percent spending cut directive that are included inÂ  Prime Cuts Â  2018 , as well as proposed in whole or in part in the PresidentâsÂ  Major Savings and Reforms Â for FYs 2018 and 2019.

    <content type="text">The House is expected to vote next week on a bill to crack down on drug companies that overcharge the government, according to two House aides. 

The bipartisan bill is aimed at stopping a repeat of the actions from Mylan, the maker of EpiPen, which made headlines last year for overcharging the Medicaid program for its commonly used product by as much as $1.27 billion over 10 years. 

The bill, from Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), allows the government to fine drug companies that misclassify their drugs as generics in order to give smaller discounts to the government. 

Mylan, the EpiPen maker, paid a settlement of $465 million last year for misclassifying its drug in that way. 

âThis legislation is a significant step forward to fixing the problems in our health care system that have allowed pharmaceutical manufacturers to price gouge taxpayers and consumers for too long,â Grassley said in a statement earlier this week upon introducing the bill. 

The rare congressional action on drug prices could be a sign of things to come next year, when Democrats hope to take much more sweeping action after taking control of the House. 

Grassley, who is often willing to oppose drug companies, is also taking over the Senate Finance Committee, where he could move forward on additional drug-pricing legislation. 

Wyden has said he hopes the legislation could become law by the end of the year. It is expected to pass the House next week as part of a larger package that includes the ACE Kids Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at improving care for children with complex medical needs. 

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main trade group for drug companies, said it is still reviewing the Grassley-Wyden legislation, but that it has âconcerns.â The group warned the bill could allow Medicaid to drop coverage of a drug erroneously if there is a dispute over whether a company is overcharging or not.</content>

December 07, 2018 -Â On average, Americans pay 80 percent more for the costliest physician-administered drugs than patients in other developed countries, according to a key HHS advisor. 
 
âFree market advocates and those who have philosophical concerns about government price fixing should be among the most vocal opponents of the status quo,â HHS Senior Advisor for Drug Pricing Reform John OâBrien writes in a recent defense of the Trump Administrationâs International Pricing Index (IPI) model on the federal agencyâs official blog. 
 
The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services recently asked the public how drug companies can be made to give American doctors and patients better deals on Medicare Part B drugs. Somehow, that sparked accusations of importing price controls, threatening patient access and jeopardizing new cures. âItâs time to set the record straight,â assert OâBrien. 
 
The Trump Administration was called on by Americans for Tax Reform to âensure that other countries remove their innovative-destroying policies,â he noted. Whatâs more, the group recently accused the administration of surrendering to foreign countries on drug prices. 
 
âThat couldnât be more wrong,â claims OâBrien who noted the HHS recently called out the extent of foreign free-riding in Medicare Part B while the CMS sought public feedback on an IPI demonstration project that could become the first effective tool against foreign price controls. 
 
Hereâs how it would work, according to OâBrien. Drug companies that donât agree to prices demanded by foreign governments neednât do business there or can negotiate a price more in line with what Americans pay. Therefore, theyâd be unaffected. Or they could continue giving cheaper prices to countries overseas and take a cut in their drugsâ reimbursement from Medicare. 
 
In October, The New York Times  reported that President Trump proposed Medicare would pay for certain prescription drugs based on the prices paid in other advanced industrial countries â a huge change that could save money for the government and for millions of Medicare beneficiaries. 
 
âThis is a revolutionary change,â the President said in a speech at the HHS. âNobodyâs had the courage to do it, or they just didnât want to do it.â 
 
The drug proposal would take effect in the latter part of 2019 or early 2020. HHS has the authority to use the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation created by the Affordable Care Act to execute the proposal, said White House officials. 
 
While the administration will accept public comments prior to initiating the project, the proposal will most likely face fierce political resistance from drug makers, some health care providers and some Republicans in Congress. It also could face legal challenges. 
 
By law, the Medicare program canât negotiate drug prices. Under the Trump Administration proposal, private-sector vendors would negotiate down drug prices and supply the medicines to doctors and hospitals. 
 
HHS said the proposed rule would cover most of the drugs in Medicareâs Part B, which includes expensive physician-administered drugs such as infusions. 
 
According to HHS projections, the rule would save $17.2 billion over five years. The federal government and Medicare beneficiaries both would benefit. 
 
Trump has criticized foreign governments with single-payer healthcare systems, such as the UK and France, that can negotiate prices directly with drug companies and often pay far less for the same medications than the U.S, which doesnât directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. 
 
âThe IPI demo doesnât just seek to end foreign free-riding, it introduces competition and negotiation to Medicare Part B drugs and provides drug companies with a valid reason to walk away from the negotiating table when other countries demand low prices subsidized by Americaâs seniors,â continued OâBrien. The socialist systems to whom drug companies are giving better deals simply do not have monopoly power when compared to the importance of participating in the Medicare program. 
 
âDrug companies would have you believe that the current Average Sales Price system represents the free market,â OâBrien remarked. âBut for at least 30 percent of Part B spending, Medicare prices are at least half of the market; meaning thereâs effectively no competition within that substantial federal spending among competing products. So, Medicare just pays the bill. Itâs a crazy system, and it has to change.â 
 
Furthermore, âwe believe the IPI model may well mean that, as our prices drop, other countriesâ prices rise. But it doesnât mean that Americaâs seniors will experience access restrictions.â 
 
For those who claim that this proposal hampers future innovation, remember that the best way to support future pharmaceutical innovation is to build a sustainable market-based system for pricing prescription drugs, he said. âThatâs the goal of this proposal.â</content>

    <content type="text">Not president, not yet a senator: Romney is starting over

By LAURIE KELLMAN and STEVE PEOPLES

Associated Press

Friday, November 30

WASHINGTON (AP)  Mitt Romney is a man in-between.

He made it to Washington after all  but not as president of the United States, the office he sought twice and other men won. Heâs not yet a senator from Utah, either, until heâs sworn in Jan. 3. Romney, lifelong executive in public and private life, doesnât have a permanent office, a place to live or a solid sense of what it will be like to shift from being the top leader to just one of 100 ambitious personalities.

For now, Romney, 71, is acclimating to the rarified Senate, where heâs shuttling between his temporary basement office and meetings, little-noticed in the brimming corridors of power where seniority and tradition rule. Behind him is real-world fame as the former standard-bearer of the Republican Party, now commanded by President Donald Trump and his in-your-face style. Ahead of Romney is life as a junior senator in a role Senate leaders are just beginning to sketch out. âItâs been a learning experience,â Romney said Tuesday as he hurried from a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a suite that overlooks the National Mall. âHopefully, I have the capacity to take on different roles.â

Romney is from neither Massachusetts, where he was governor, nor Utah, where he lives and which he will represent in the new, 116th Congress. Heâs from Michigan, where his father, George W. Romney, was governor in the 1960s. But Romney earned his status as Utahâs adopted son when in 1999 he took over the Salt Lake City Olympics and helped steer it through a bribery scandal to successful games three years later.

After being governor, the presidency was Romneyâs goal. But in 2008, he lost the Republican nomination to Sen. John McCain, who then lost the big prize to Democrat Barack Obama. Four years later, it was Romney and then-Rep. Paul Ryan challenging Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. Romney went down in defeat, derided by some in the GOP as too moderate and disconnected from the economic struggles of most Americans. Then Trump won the nationâs highest office over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

All along, Romneyâs relationship with Trump has veered between bitter rivalry and potential  but unrealized  alliance. Thatâs raised hopes on Capitol Hill that Romney might serve as a truth-teller to a president who routinely replaces fact with fiction. Some are hoping that the mild-mannered Romney bucks his party on policy when he chooses.

âI think with John McCain passing, for example, Mitt believes that thereâs a role for him in our party in being â¦ a standard-bearer in our party,â said Ryan, now the retiring House speaker, told The Washington Post Thursday. Ryan and others said theyâre looking for Romney to seek a seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to help build back relationships that Trumpâs âAmerica firstâ policy may have eroded.

Committee assignments  let alone Romneyâs role  will in large part be determined by McConnell, other Senate veterans and tradition. As a junior senator, Romney will be seated toward the end of the committee rostrum. Heâll be among the last asked to speak, and heâll have to wait awhile to make his maiden floor speech.

On the upside, Romney will get a bit of rank among freshmen for having been a governor.

âBut not much,â chortled Sen. Roy Blunt, whoâs known the Romneys for years. Blunt said heâs spoken with Romney several times about the transition from having been an executive to serving in an institution where work and collaboration  and yes, a degree of deference  matter most.

âBeing a governor where you can say, âIâd like this to happen today,â and in many instances it actually happens today, is a lot different than being a senator where things take time and things seldom work out exactly the way you want them to,â Blunt said. âYou have to pivot and move forward. For Gov. Romney, coming to the Senate is one way to pivot and move forward and thatâs an important trait to have, if youâre going to be an effective part of the Senate.â

âEverybody already knows him,â said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. âI donât think he has any sense of regret. I think heâs eager to jump right in.â

Those close to Romney point out that unlike most freshmen, Romney comes to Congress with years-long relationships with many members, including with McConnell. His niece is Republican National Committee Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel. And as a presidential candidate, he helped raise huge sums of money for congressional colleagues over the last decade.

There are signs that Romney intends to keep up that role in Washington, where campaign cash-raising prowess can confer influence. On Tuesday night, his recently-formed Believe in America PAC and joint fundraising committee, Team Mitt, held its first fund raiser in Washington. Attendees were asked to contribute $5,000.

On the issues, Romney is eager to play a role in foreign policy, fiscal policy and, to a lesser degree, immigration, according to close advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions.

While his relationship with Trump has improved dramatically, underlying tensions remain. In June, after Romney predicted Trump would win a second term, Trump said: âMittâs a straight shooter  whether people love him or donât love him.â

Throughout his Senate campaign, Romney insisted that he would agree with Trump on some issues and not be shy about disagreeing on others.

Look for the Republican heavyweights to clash on foreign policy, perhaps above all.

Romney continues to believe that Russia remains Americaâs greatest geopolitical foe, a position he first outlined in 2012 that puts him in direct conflict with Trump, who has warmed to Russian President Vladimir Putin. And Romney was quick to condemn Trumpâs muted response to Saudi Arabiaâs brutal killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Senate Democrats report cordial welcome-to-Washington conversations with Romney, but theyâre hesitant to predict that heâll be a bridge between them and empowered Senate Republicans.

âI think he brings a lot to the table as a new senator with a national reputation, from a conservative state,â said Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, who said he chatted with Romney at a recent dinner. âWeâll see what happens.â

Washingtonâs new power standoff - Trump, Pelosi

By LISA MASCARO, JONATHAN LEMIRE and CATHERINE LUCEY

Associated Press

Friday, November 30

WASHINGTON (AP)  They havenât spoken in days, not since President Donald Trump called to congratulate Nancy Pelosi on Democratsâ election night win.

But they donât really need to. Trump and Pelosi go way back, from the time she first showed up at Trump Tower fundraising for the Democrats long before he would become president or she the House speaker. Two big-name heirs to big-city honchos  Trump and Pelosi each had fathers who were political power players in their home towns  theyâve rubbed elbows on the Manhattan social scene for years.

And despite daily barbs in Washington, heâs always âMr. Presidentâ to her, and sheâs one prominent politician he has not labeled with a derisive nickname.

Not quite friends, nor enemies, theirs is perhaps the most important relationship in Washington. If anything is to come of the new era of divided government, with a Republican president and Democratic control of the House, it will happen in the deal-making space between two of the countryâs most polarizing politicians.

The day after their election night phone call, Trump and Pelosi did speak again, indirectly, across Pennsylvania Avenue.

âI really respected what Nancy said last night about bipartisanship and getting together and uniting,â Trump said in a press conference at the White House. âThatâs what we should be doing.â

Pressed after his unusual public lobbying for Pelosi to become House speaker, Trump insisted he was sincere.

âA lot of people thought I was being sarcastic or I was kidding. I wasnât. I think she deserves it,â he said. âI also believe that Nancy Pelosi and I could work together and get a lot of things done.â

Pelosi sent word back a few minutes later from her own press conference at the Capitol, which she delayed for nearly an hour as the president conducted his.

âLast night, I had a conversation with President Trump about how we could work together,â Pelosi said, noting that âbuilding infrastructureâ was one of the items they discussed.

âHe talked about it during his campaign and really didnât come through with it in his first two years in office,â she nudged. âI hope that we can do that because we want to create jobs from sea to shining sea.â

Despite all the campaign trail trash talk, both Trump and Pelosi have incentive to make some deals.

The president could use a domestic policy win heading into his own re-election in 2020, alongside his regular railing against illegal immigration, the âwitch huntâ of the Russia investigation or other issues that emerge from his tweets.

Democrats, too, need to show Americans they can do more than resist the Trump White House. Itâs no surprise that two of the top Democratic priorities in the new Congress, infrastructure investment and lowering health care costs, dovetail with promises Trump made to voters, but has not yet fulfilled.

âI do think thereâs opportunities to pass legislation,â said former White House legislative director Marc Short.

Trump has long viewed Pelosi as both a foil and a possible partner, and she sees in him the one who can sign legislation into law.

The president has told confidants that he respects Pelosiâs deal-making prowess and her ability to hang on to power in the face of a series of challenges from the left wing of the party, according to four White House officials and Republicans close to the White House. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations and requested anonymity.

He told one ally this month that he respected Pelosi âas a fighterâ and that he viewed her as someone with whom he could negotiate.

âThe president respects her,â said Short.

Short described the interaction between Pelosi and Trump during a 2017 meeting with other congressional leaders at the White House to prevent a government shutdown. âThey were throwing pros and cons back at each other,â he said.

âThe question I canât answer is to what extent will Democrats give Pelosi political bandwidthâ to strike deals, Short said. He pointed to potential areas of agreement like infrastructure, drug prices and prison reform.

But part of Trumpâs push for Pelosi to return to power was more nakedly political. Pelosi has long been a popular Republican target, spurring countless fundraising efforts and attack ads. And Trump has told advisers that, if needed, he would make her the face of the opposition in Democratic party until the 2020 presidential field sorts itself out.

Pelosiâs name draws some of the biggest jeers at his rallies and he believes that âshe could be Hillaryâ in terms of a Clinton-like figure to rally Republicans against, according to one of the advisers familiar with the presidentâs private conversations.

At the same time, Trump has not publicly branded Pelosi with a mocking nickname. Sheâs no âCryinââ Chuck Schumer, as he calls the top Senate Democrat, or âLittleâ Adam Schiff at the Intelligence Committee or âLow IQâ Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who will chair the Financial Services Committee.

On whether Trump likes Pelosi as ally or adversary, Short said, âI donât think those are mutually exclusive.â

Pelosi, perhaps more than her Republican counterparts  outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  became an early observer, and adapter, to the Trump style of governing.

When Trump and Democrats were trying to broker an immigration deal in September 2017, she suggested he could tweet his assurances to the young Dreamers. And he did.

Around the same time when Trump and congressional leaders convened at the White House to avoid a federal government shutdown, Republicans and Trumpâs own Cabinet team pressed for their preferred solution. But Pelosi kept asking a simple question: How many Republican votes could they bring to the table? When it was clear they could not bring enough for passage, Trump intervened and agreed with Democrats âChuck and Nancy,â as he came to call them.

Votes, Pelosi explained later, were the âcurrency of the realm.â Trump, as a businessman, she said, got it.

Pelosi is poised to become House speaker again if she wins her election in January. Asked this week how Trump might react to having a woman in power, Pelosi recalled the first time she held the office, when George W. Bush was president, in 2007.

Bush would call her âNo. 3,â she said, a reference to the speakerâs spot in the presidential succession line, after the president and the vice president.

âHe treated me and the office I hold with great respect,â she said. âI would expect nothing less than that from this President of the United States.â

    <content type="text">ST. JOSEPH â For the fourth consecutive year, Spectrum Health Lakeland has been recognized among "HealthCare's Most Wired" hospitals and health systems in an annual survey recently released by the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME). The annual survey identifies and recognizes health care organizations that exemplify best practices through their adoption, implementation and use of information technology," according to CHIME.

More than 675 organizations, representing 2,190 hospitals, participated in this year's survey.

The report found two key areas that emerged in 2018: the use of foundational technologies, such as integration, interoperability, security and disaster recovery; and the use of transformational technologies to support population health management, value-based care, patient engagement and telehealth.

These foundational pieces need to be in place for an organization to leverage tools to effectively transform health care.

"This is a great acknowledgement of the team's continued excellence and innovative approach to leveraging technology to enable high levels of quality care," Jason Joseph, Spectrum Health senior vice president and chief information officer, said in a news release.

    <content type="text">WASHINGTON (Sinclair Broadcast Group) âÂ  
Health care spending in the United States topped $10,000 per person in 2017, which is undeniably a lot of money, but it actually represents a deceleration of the upward trend in health expenditures to pre-Affordable Care Act levels. 

According to the Office of the Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , national health spending grew at a rate of 3.9 percent last year, with Medicare spending up by 4.2 percent and Medicaid up by 2.9 percent. Private insurance spending rose 4.2 percent and out-of-pocket expenditures increased 2.9 percent. 

Total expenditures hit a record $3.5 trillion in 2017, but the 3.9 percent increase was notably less than the 4.8 percent rise in 2016, which was down from a 5.8 percent increase in 2015. Acceleration in health care spending had previously dipped below 4 percent in the wake of the Great Recession, reaching the lowest rate on record, 3.6 percent, in 2013 before the ACA took effect. 


After years of rapidly rising costs, 2017 marks the second consecutive year that the rate at which spending was increasing slowed. Health care spending as a percentage of gross domestic product went down slightly, from 18 percent in 2016 to 17.9 percent in 2017, but expenditures are still growing faster than wages and the economy as a whole. 

Experts attribute the relative stabilization of health care costs to several factors. 

More than half of health care spending in 2017 went toward hospitals, physicians, and clinical services, and CMS reported those categories saw slower growth in both the use and intensity of services. Hospital spending slowed for private insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid. 

Retail drug spending, which accounts for 10 percent of all costs, grew 0.4 percent in 2017, 12 percentage points slower than it did three years earlier. CMS attributes a spike in drug expenditures in 2014 and 2015 to the introduction of expensive new medicines and higher prices for brand-name drugs. 

âRetail prescription drug spending growth slowed in 2017 primarily due to slower growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed, a continued shift to lower-cost generic drugs, slower growth in the volume of some high-cost drugs, declines in generic drug prices, and lower price increases for existing brand-name drugs,â the report stated. 

Most other categories of expenditures saw similar dips in the rate of growth, but spending on other health, residential, and personal care services and on durable medical equipment accelerated slightly. 

All major sources of health care funds grew at slower rates in 2017, including Medicare and Medicaid. Out-of-pocket spending, which accounted for 10 percent of funds, grew 2.6 percent, down from 4.4 percent in 2016. About one-third of expenditures came from private health insurance spending, which increased by 4.2 percent to $1.2 trillion, compared to 6.2 percent in 2016. 

âThe deceleration was influenced by slower growth in medical benefits and a decline in fees and taxes resulting from the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016, which suspended collection of the health insurance provider fee in 2017,â CMS stated. 

The increase of the insured population triggered by the Affordable Care Act imposed significant new costs on the government and insurers in 2014 and 2015. One major element of that was the expansion of Medicaid to millions of new patients. Those costs are largely baked into the system now, though. 

âThe slowdown is likely because the uninsured rate stopped declining in 2017,â said Vivian Ho, director of the Center for Health and Biosciences at Rice Universityâs Baker Institute for Public Policy. âIn 2015 and 2016, more people were becoming insured and therefore spending more on healthcare with their extra coverage.â 

That trend will likely continue. For the first time in years, the number of uninsured Americans rose in 2018. ACA open enrollment for 2019 is nearly over and signups are down significantly. Some of this is attributable to Virginia accepting the Medicaid expansion or more employers offering coverage, but with the individual mandate gone, millions are expected to just forgo insurance. 

Although the ACA contributed heavily to rising costs for several years, total health expenditures are still below what they were projected to be before the law passed. According to the Urban Institute, CMS actuaries predicted in 2010 that spending would total nearly $4 trillion in 2017 and more than $4.5 trillion in 2019. 

Some have posited that deceleration in 2017 was in part driven by improved efficiency, but Ho sees little evidence of that in the report. Instead, she believes patients are using health care services less because changes in insurance and pricing have shifted more costs to them. 

âTo me, this is a price response by consumers,â she said. âThis is not efficiency gains Prices are getting too high and itâs squeezing the patient.â 

While the slowdown in the increase of health care costs is a positive trend, workers may not be seeing the benefits of it because insurance premiums and deductibles are still rising. A new report released by the Commonwealth Fund Friday shows employer and employee premium contributions increased at a faster rate in 2017 than overall health care costs. 

According to the report, premium and deductible costs ate up nearly 12 percent of median income for workers in 2017, up from 7.8 percent ten years earlier. This is almost as much as Americans spend on food, which averaged 13 percent of median income last year. The total cost of premiums and potential deductible spending for single and family policies averaged $7,240. 

Premiums for employer health plans varied widely by state in 2017, but they rose sharply in almost all of them, averaging a 4.4 percent increase for single plans and 5.5 percent for family plans. Single person premiums cleared $7,000 in eight states, and family premiums were $20,000 or higher in seven states. 

Worker contributions to those premiums are also up, averaging $1,415 for single plans and $5,218 for families. Deductibles for single person plans were up 6.6 percent in 2017, averaging about $1,800, with state-by-state figures ranging from $863 in Hawaii to $2,300 in Maine and New Hampshire. 

âThe cost of employer health insurance premiums and deductibles continues to outpace growth in workersâ wages. This is concerning, because it may put both coverage and health care out of reach for people who need it most â people with low incomes and those with health problems,â said Sara Collins, lead author of the Commonwealth Fund study, in a statement. 

After the rate of the increase in health expenditures dropped two years in a row, health economists point to a number of reforms that could keep the system moving in that direction and save money for the government, insurers, and patients. 

âA lot of policymakers have been in favor of allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for drugs,â Ho said. 

The Trump administration has laid out a blueprint for lowering prescription drug costs, but Ho has doubts about that plan. She also warned hospital consolidations and mergers are reducing competition and raising prices in many communities without much scrutiny. 

The Center for American Progress also sounded an alarm about hospital and provider consolidation juicing up costs in a report released this week. The report recommends stepping up antitrust enforcement, improving transparency in billing, establishing a patient ombudsman, and capping some prices. 

âHospitals and physician practices are increasingly likely to belong to dominant, multi-provider health systems, which often charge higher prices without improving the quality of patient care,â said co-author Emily Gee. âWhile transparency and choice can be helpful, the current situation stunts competition and demands stronger antitrust enforcement and policies to directly address health care prices.â 

The Commonwealth Fund study looked at ways to lift some costs off patients, though most of the steps would transfer the expenses to their employers or the government. 

âPolicies that would reduce health care burdens on employees include fixing the Affordable Care Actâs family coverage glitch, requiring employers to exclude some services from the deductible, and increasing the required minimum value of employer plans,â Collins said. 

Under the ACA, tax penalties for employers kick in if premiums exceed 9.5 percent of workersâ income, but that provision applies only to single-person plans, which leaves many middle-income families unable to take advantage of it. The Commonwealth Fund recommends tying the penalty to the more expensive family plans instead. 

People receiving employer coverage currently become eligible for marketplace subsidies if their plan covers less than 60 percent of health care costs. The report calls for increasing that threshold to 70 percent or higher. It also suggests offering refundable tax credits for people who have insurance to pay for out-of-pocket costs that exceed a set percentage of their income. 

âIncome-related cost protections like these will need to be paired with systemwide efforts to slow medical spending,â the Commonwealth Fund report states. âThese efforts could include: innovation in care organization and provider payment to achieve greater value and better health outcomes, addressing the increasing concentration of insurer and provider markets through antitrust policy, and slowing the growth rate of prescription drug costs.â 

Few of these policy prescriptions have much hope of being adopted in 2019 with a Democrat-controlled House, a Republican Senate majority, and a president focused on other priorities. The GOP effort to repeal the ACA is presumed dead, but a lawsuit pending in Texas could upend the entire health insurance market and the policy debate if a judge declares the law unconstitutional. 

For now, the Trump administration is working to loosen restrictions on less expensive insurance plans that also provide fewer benefits. Some experts have raised concerns skimpy coverage will lead to higher out-of-pocket costs if people get sick, but overall spending on premiums would slip if healthier people gravitate to these plans. 

As Congress turns its attention to entitlement reform, the deceleration in Medicare and Medicaid funding could remove some urgency from the discussion, although the two programs combined cost nearly $1.3 trillion in 2017. 

"Medicaid costs are growing at close to flat. Those pushing block grants or caps for Medicaid are aiming to solve a problem that doesnât exist," former Obama administration CMS Administrator Andy Slavitt said on Twitter Thursday. 

Halting rising health care costs entirely or driving them down presents a much greater challenge than slowing them, but Ho believes it could be accomplished over time with a shift in focus from quantity of care to quality of care. 

âI think in the very long run, reducing health care costs is possible,â she said. âYou need to get the waste out of the system and thatâs very hard to do.â</content>

    <content type="text">They found ABPM was the dominant strategy across all age groups when the initial screening was positive for hypertensionâat least 140/90 mm Hg in this studyâwith lifetime savings versus clinic BP measurements ranging from $77 for the average 80-year-old woman to $5,013 for the average 21-year-old woman. Lifetime costs were calculated from the U.S. healthcare payer perspective and estimated out to age 85 for each individual, meaning follow-up ranged from five to 64 years depending on the group being studied. 

Lifetime cost savings for men who initially screened positive for hypertension ranged from $147 at age 80 to $4,671 at age 21 with ABPM instead of clinic measurements. HBPM was the most expensive of all the strategies across age groups. 
 
When patients didnât initially have hypertension, ABPM was associated with cost savings for all patients 70 or youngerâranging from $128 for 70-year-old women to $2,794 for 21-year-old women. For 80-year-olds of both sexes, clinic readings were most cost-effective. 
 
âOverall, the findings of this study suggest that using ABPM is the strategy of choice for hypertension diagnosis and treatment initiation for most adults in primary care settings,â wrote Beyhaghi, with the University of North Carolina; and Viera, with Duke University. âWe predict that correctly diagnosing white-coat and masked hypertension by ABPM reduces the overall cost of treatment for hypertension and future cardiovascular disease events.â 
 
The authors used a hypothetical study cohort of primary care patients who matched the general U.S. population in terms of cardiovascular risk factors. They used previously published data to inform their calculations of costs related to antihypertensive medications, hospital stays associated with specific events and maintenance costs related to coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease. The Framingham risk equations were used to determine age- and sex-specific probabilities of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occurring in both hypertensive and normotensive patients.</content>

The shift to value-based care (VBC) is well underway, and Episodes of Care (EOC) are an integral part of payersâ transition from volume-to-value. Thatâs a core finding of a 2018 bi-annual survey conducted by ORC International and sponsored by Change Healthcare; the two organizations have partnered since 2014 to track payersâ progress implementing VBC models and payment structures.

    <content type="text">The pharmaceutical industry is extremely resourceful when it comes to pushing high-priced drugs in the health-care market. Industry representatives shower doctors with free samples of their priciest products to pass onto patients. Consumers are targeted by ads urging them to âask your doctorâ about this or that new treatment. 

But when doctors prescribe the most expensive medicinal options, it affects not only their patients and their health plans, but also employers, taxpayers and the entire health-care system, which is plagued by perpetually increasing costs. 

Thatâs why Medicare, Ohio Medicaid, private insurers and employers all have implemented something called step therapy. Step therapy is a science-based approach to help patients address their medical conditions with a safe, cost-effective therapy before that patient is prescribed a more-complex, costlier, or riskier drug. 

A recent study found that if state Medicaid programs used tools such as step therapy to help detect and avoid inappropriate use, $1.9 billion could be saved over the next 10 years. 

The Congressional Budget Office has indicated that, in the absence of common techniques such as step therapy, premiums for plans would be 5 to 10 percent higher than current levels. 

Considering the current trajectory of health-care costs, such an increase is unacceptable and unsustainable. 

Out-of-control drug prices leave too many Ohioans to choose between paying their bills or paying for their medications.Â The problem is the price, driven by monopolies in a broken market that empower branded drugmakers to raise prices on the same products year after year.Â Increases in the cost of prescription-drug coverage dramatically impact the ability of many patients to obtain affordable health-care coverage, and threaten the ability of small employers to provide coverage for their employees. 

Just two weeks ago, Pfizer announced it will increase the list prices of 41 of its medications by 5 percent beginning in January. From EpiPens and naloxone to insulin and muscular dystrophy drugs, rising and erratic drug pricing has added to the overall cost of U.S. health care and placed undue burden and uncertainty on Ohioans. 

Easing that burden is one benefit of step therapy, but not the only one. It also helps to keep patients safe, encouraging them to gauge their responses to less-dangerous drugs before transitioning them to more-potent medications. This is especially important at a time when Ohio is at the center of the nationâs opiate epidemic. Step-therapy protocols allow insurers to provide enhanced disease management while reducing the risk of overmedication or exposing patients to highly addictive drugs. 

Thatâs not to say there are no flaws within step therapy. Some patients who have already gone through a step-therapy process to determine the proper medication for their needs are required to repeat the process if they switch health plans due to a new job or change in employer insurance. This is wrong and must be fixed. 

That is why Ohioâs health plans have consistently advocated for state law that would protect patients from having to repeat step therapy if they switch plans. 

We are optimistic the Ohio General Assembly will pass a bill that will accomplish this. But the legislation was almost sabotaged by other language in Senate Bill 56 that would have undermined the step-therapy process altogether, exposing Ohioans to higher drug costs. 

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) aggressively pushed language that would have chipped away at step therapy by using a very broad exemption, making it easier for the industry to sell its most expensive drugs in Ohio â saddling Ohioans with the costs associated with those pricey drugs. 

Thankfully, Ohio lawmakers pushed back on the drug lobbyâs strategy and stripped out the exemption language in S.B. 56. 

Unfortunately, however, this wasnât PhRMAâs first effort to undercut the step-therapy process, and it wonât be the last. 

All of us in the health-care system should fight to preserve step therapy because it protects patients while taking a step toward addressing a national crisis: the spiraling cost of health care.

*** Jeremy Glaser: This week on Morningstar we are featuring five real-life portfolio makeovers by Christine Benz, our director of personal finance. She is joining me today to talk about how to do your own portfolio makeover. Christine, thanks for joining me.

Christine Benz: Jeremy, it's great to be here.

Glaser: The first thing that you need to do to actually have your own portfolio makeover is to gather all the information, right?

Benz: That's right. This is something I put all of our portfolio makeover candidates through, I ask them to provide me with a lot of data. Account statements, the most recent account statements you can find; Social Security statements, so you can project your benefits; if you are someone who is covered by a pension, you want to gather those pension documents and get your arms around what sort of pension benefits you might be able to rely on in retirement. Definitely, data gathering would be the first step. Glaser: Once you have that basic piece down, you should start evaluating your progress toward your goal?

Benz: Right. That's the key thing I think about when I'm looking at these portfolios is just, is this plan on track. For accumulators you want to gauge the adequacy of what you've managed to save so far, and here I really like the Fidelity benchmarks where they have different savings targets by age band. I think those can be a good starting point for people. I also think for accumulators this is a great place to turn to some an online retirement calculator to gauge the viability of your progress so far. One I have often recommended is T. Rowe Price's retirement income calculator, but a lot of financial providers have their own calculators and tools. Run through a few of them just to get a sense of whether your current balance plus your ongoing savings rate puts you on track to reach your retirement goal.

If you are someone who is already retired, you want to think about your withdrawal rate and think about perhaps the 4% guideline as a starting point for gauging your portfolio's withdrawal rate. I've written a lot about this topic over the past few years. People want to think about their own portfolio's asset allocation as well as where they are in their retirement trajectory. People who are young retirees, say, under 65, would want to be much more conservative than 4%, whereas older retirees maybe able to be a little bit more aggressive in their withdrawals. But that's definitely the key thing to think about for people who are already retired and drawing from their portfolios.

Glaser: The next step is to look at your overall asset allocation.

Benz: That's right. Here I like Morningstar's X-Ray tool. If you've gathered up all of your account statements, you can enter all of your holdings in Morningstar's Portfolio Manager or use our Instant X-Ray tool to enter those holdings. That way you can get a read on your total portfolio's asset allocation. Then you want to just gauge whether that's reasonable. If you are someone who is accumulating assets for retirement or already retired, you might use Morningstar's Lifetime Allocation Indexes, which are put together by our colleagues in Morningstar Investment Management. Or you might use a good target-date fund or two just to see, well, is my asset allocation, is it in the same ballpark as what these professionals are recommending. If it's not, and you might have a very good reason for it not to be--why not, and make sure that you are thinking that through.

Glaser: That gives you a sense of that broader asset allocation of stocks versus bonds, say. But there could still be allocations on sectors or style-box weightings that you'd want to take a closer look at as well?

Benz: That's right. This is something I certainly look at when conducting the portfolio makeovers. Here again, I think our X-Ray functionality can be super helpful. You are looking at sector positioning relative to the S&amp;P 500. You are also looking at your portfolio's style-box exposure. Are you listing heavily toward one side of the style-box or the other? Are you listing heavily toward small stocks versus large? Not to say that you can't have some of those bets in your portfolio, if you have a good reason for positioning your portfolio that way. But just saying that you want to be aware of them and make sure that you are not making any big, scary inadvertent bets.

Glaser: This is also a time to check out to make sure you don't have too much overweight in any given security?

Benz: That's right. Here again, X-Ray has the stock intersection tool that shows you how much you have in various securities in your portfolio. You want to take a look at that, and make sure that you haven't inadvertently made a big bet on some stock by buying it outright when maybe a mutual fund in your portfolio also holds it. Watch out for very large individual stock bets. Certainly, if you have employer stock as a part of your plan, that can be a big risk factor for a lot of people because their financial wherewithal is also riding on the company. Watch out for that as well.

Glaser: If you are looking to streamline your accounts a little bit, streamline your portfolio, what would be some ways to do that here?

Benz: This is definitely something that should be part of any portfolio makeover process. Start at the account level. See if there aren't like-account types that you can collapse together. Maybe you have old rollover IRAs, multiple versions of them that you can put together into one large IRA, for example. That will reduce your oversight on an ongoing basis. Start with accounts, then move on to holdings. You may have holdings that are redundant with one another. Or maybe you have one large-cap growth fund that largely duplicates exposure that you are getting through your total market index fund. Look for opportunities to streamline, ideally at the same time, to lower costs and improve your overall holdings quality at the same time.

Glaser: How about taxes?

Benz: This is another great opportunity to look at improving your portfolio's tax efficiency. If you are making contributions, are you making them to your tax-sheltered vehicles? If you have taxable accounts, are those accounts as tax-efficient as possible? For a lot of people, this is as simple as holding equity exchange-traded funds as well as municipal bonds and bond funds for their taxable accounts. Finally, for people who are already in drawdown mode, it makes sense to think about tax-efficient withdrawal sequencing. That's a topic that I've written a lot about on Morningstar.com, where you are basically hanging on to those accounts with the best tax benefits, like Roth accounts, to last in your withdrawal queue and potentially tapping less tax-efficient accounts before them.

Glaser: What other risk factors should you be considering when doing a makeover?

Benz: You really want to look inward and think about your own personal risks. Some recent examples from makeovers have included people who haven't insured against long-term care. That's certainly a big risk factor for people later in life that they might incur these large unfunded costs. You want to think about, if I haven't insured against long-term care costs, do I have enough assets in my portfolio to cover those costs later in life. Another recent example was an individual who had a pension that she would be bringing into retirement, but the pension covered her life only, and there would be no benefit for her husband if she predeceased him. You want to think about problem spots like that that could arrive. In this case, the recommendation was that they purchase life insurance should she predecease her husband. Think about all of your individual-specific risk factors. I think that that should definitely be part of any sort of portfolio makeover process.

Glaser: Christine, thank you.

Benz: Thank you, Jeremy.

Glaser: For Morningstar, I'm Jeremy Glaser. Thanks for watching.

Jeremy Glaser: For Morningstar, I'm Jeremy Glaser. With volatility in the stock market dominating the headlines again, many investors might be wondering if they can or if they should reduce risk in their portfolio. I'm here with Christine Benz, she is our director of personal finance. We are going to take a closer look at four light ways to reduce risk.

Christine, thanks for joining me.

Christine Benz: Jeremy, it's great to be here.

Glaser: Maybe we should start with what generally isn't advisable, and that's just a wholesale de-risking of an entire portfolio, particularly for investors that are far away from retirement.

Benz: Yeah, that is not a strategy I would advise. It does perhaps provide some short-term peace of mind if you are seeing the market drop a lot over a period of days or weeks. It can provide some short-term comfort to just get out of everything altogether, move everything to the safe investment on offer in your investment program. 

The key reason why you don't want to do that is that inevitably you will be stuck wondering when do I get back in. Because the market often is streaky and will often log its best days on a series of short bursts as opposed to a slow, steady progression. That sort of relief can quickly be replaced with worry about, well, am I doing the right thing here and when is the best time to edge back into stocks.

Glaser: Your first tip for a light way to de-risk is to potentially cut back on stocks through rebalancing, that this is a great time to look at your asset allocation.

Benz: Absolutely. And you know, I sometimes wince when I hear people on TV or in other places saying nobody do anything, the market is down. Well, guess what, a lot of people haven't been doing anything with their portfolios for 10 years. That means that they could in fact be heavier on equities relative to their life stage than they actually should be if they have just been letting their winners ride. 

So, even if you haven't done anything and your portfolio balance has been sinking lower and your equity holdings have been sinking lower, it's still maybe the right call to de-risk that portfolio a little bit, to take some money off the table in stocks and move it into bonds or perhaps cash. That will tend to be less advisable, the younger you are, the more you should use the market dips as an opportunity to add more to stocks not less. But for people who are getting close to retirement, people who are 50 and above, absolutely, they should use our X-Ray functionality, see where they are now, compare it to a target, and see if some de-risking is in order.

Glaser: Within asset classes, too, your second tip is to maybe think about being in more defensive sectors or in more defensive bond funds.

Benz: Absolutely. Because again, if investors have been just kind of letting their winners ride, they will tend to have a concentration in the growth side of the style box, even though that's been the epicenter of the recent market weakness. In fact, some of the portfolios that I've been working on in our portfolio makeover series have been very heavy on growth stocks. So, check that out. 

Think about especially again if you are someone who is getting close to drawdown, getting close to retirement, think about giving your portfolio equity weighting a little bit more of a defensive cast. You might emphasize quality more. If you are an individual stock picker, you might focus on what we call wide-moat companies. You might emphasize dividends a little more. You might also invest in some sort of a product that focuses on the subset of stocks that we classify as low volatility or that index providers classify as low volatility. Those are ways to stay in equities, but give your portfolio a little bit more of a conservative bias.

You can do the same on the bond side, where you might have in your portfolio some lower quality bond holdings, maybe some more income-focused bond holdings. If you are concerned about volatility related to the equity market, make sure that your bond holdings are really ballast for you, that they are going to deliver for you on days when the equity market sells off. That's generally high-quality bonds. Long duration bonds often perform best on big equity market down days. But I think for investors who are looking for a low-risk bond portfolio, they would probably want to focus on short and intermediate-duration bonds.

Glaser: You say this is a time to potentially reduce idiosyncratic risk. What do you mean by that?

Benz: I think that's a great thing to do at times like these. Scout around your portfolio just to see if you are taking any big "dumb" risks in your portfolio--things like major style concentrations, major sector concentrations, major concentrations in individual holdings. Company stock is one that I would call out as something to avoid a big concentrated bet in, because so much of your individual wherewithal is riding on your company's fortunes. That's a place to look if you are attempting to reduce security-specific risk in your portfolio.

Glaser: Finally, you think this could be a good time to review your portfolio maintenance regimen. Why is that?

Benz: Well, I would say, for people who have specific holdings that are causing them a lot of angst, there are maybe some tweaks that you could make without completely upending your plan to reduce your exposure to those very volatile positions. For people who are making additional ongoing contributions, say, through a 401(k) plan, maybe you just reduce your future contributions to those holdings, not your contributions overall, but to those problematic holdings. That would be one way to maybe buy yourself a little peace of mind.

Another idea is, if you are kind of in maintenance mode with your portfolio, where you are neither adding to it or withdrawing from it necessarily, reinvesting the dividends and capital gains distributions--a lot of us have those boxes checked with our fund providers--maybe uncheck them for the holdings that are again causing you the most angst and causing the most volatility in your portfolio. You are not bailing out of them altogether, but you are just saying, well, for now at least, I'm not going to commit additional capital.

And finally, for retirees, I do think that they have an opportunity if they have holdings that they found especially problematic to tie their scaling back on those positions in with whatever withdrawal system they are using. If they are pulling from their portfolio anyway, why not pull from those holdings that are causing them a lot of angst. Those are some easy ways to reduce exposure to positions without getting out of those positions altogether.

Glaser: Christine, thank you.

Benz: Thank you, Jeremy.

Glaser: For Morningstar, I'm Jeremy Glaser. Thanks for watching.

Damien Conover: The U.S. election is recently completed, and the outcome has left us with a split Congress which has implications for the healthcare sector that I think investors need to be aware of.

When we take a step back, we think the split Congress will likely mean less radical change to U.S. healthcare policies. What that means is, we'll likely see smaller implementation of past laws that have already been voted on but not yet enacted. We want to walk through some of those, and then, also, what is likely to happen from the rhetoric standpoint.

We think the most important upcoming change is an increase into the Donut Hole Discount. What that means is, when patients get to a certain point in spending, their drug prices are going to change by the amount of the discount offered by the drug companies. The discount historically had been at about 50%, that's going up to 70%. That's going to hurt the drug firms, but let's keep the magnitude in mind here. This is probably about 1% earnings hit to the large-cap pharmaceutical and large-cap biotechnology firms. This is something we think is manageable through some price increases elsewhere within the drug distribution space as well as through some cost cutting.

The second thing that's very likely to happen is increased pricing negotiation for Part B drugs. These are drugs that are administered in the hospital. This is something we think a split Congress can get behind and likely pass, so that will likely cause some more pricing headwinds for the drug and biotechnology firms, probably in the neighborhood of about a 2% hit. 

In this backdrop of increasing pricing pressure, we still think the drug space is an interesting place to invest in, because we think those costs on the drug firms are manageable. We think that the firms will be able to, again, cut costs or increase prices elsewhere to get around those increasing pricing concerns.

One thing that we think is also important is the increased rhetoric that is very likely to come out of Congress and the president's office, and that is, lowering U.S. drug prices that are something compatible to what we see in other developed markets. We think this is unlikely to actually come through. We think it's going to be more rhetoric. The reason why is, there's a high degree of complexity around bringing U.S. drug prices down to developed market prices outside the U.S., because of access issues outside the U.S. versus the U.S. That leads us to believe that it's very likely going to continue to be spoken about but not enacted.

Within this landscape of a new Congress and what we are anticipating not being major change in the political landscape, we're highlighting a couple of ideas for investors. First off is underappreciated innovation. Roche is a name we really like; very strong position in immuno-oncology as well as several other therapeutic areas we think the market is underappreciating. Also, any company that can do well in creating more value for anything within the healthcare landscape. Medtronic is a name that we think is underappreciated in this respect. They are bringing out a lot of products that have the ability to save costs for hospitals. Also, certain companies just have certain special situations that we think are well-positioned for investors. Bayer, we think there's a huge overreaction in some litigation that its crop science business is facing. We think that's an opportunity for investors.

And then, lastly, on the M&amp;A front. We think that will continue to happen. We think it's important for investors to be aware of potential opportunities of targets that could be acquired. Biomarin, we think, is at the top of this list. The reason why is this firm is focused on rare disease drugs, and this is an area where a lot of the large-cap pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms want to gain more traction, and we think an easy entry point is by acquiring Biomarin.

Stephen Ellis: The market has been, rightly, I think, skeptical around the Trump and the U.S.-China trade truce agreement announced over the weekend. We think the market is skeptical for three major reasons. 

First, if you look at the readouts from the China and the U.S. delegations, there's not necessarily a lot of agreement between the two. For example, the U.S. called for China to push for a large increase in agricultural product purchases immediately whereas the China release says nothing about that. Similarly, the China release says that the U.S. will respect China's One China policy whereas the U.S. release didn't say anything about that. So net-net, it creates a lot of confusion about what is needed for this type of agreement to be successful. 

Second, Robert Lighthizer has been appointed the new lead negotiator for the U.S.-China trade negotiations. He is generally someone who's had a harder line on China in the past, and so therefore China's going to take a while to get used to dealing with a negotiator who could, again, take time. 

Third, and most importantly, the core issues that are at stake here in terms of IP stuff, technology transfer, industrial policy, Made in China 2025, and cyber wars, these are issues that have been going on for years and, of course, extremely complicated. Resolving them in 90 days would be very unrealistic.

Allen Good: Exxon Mobil is currently trading at $77 per share, a nearly 15% discount to our $90 fair value estimate. At this level, its $0.82 quarterly dividend implies a yield of 4.3%. While lower than European peers Shell, Total, and BP, it's higher than U.S. peer Chevron at 3.9%. Historically, Exxon has yielded less than Chevron.

While the recent declines in oil prices have weighted on shares, we see the dividend as safe. Our estimate of its oil price break-even level, which is the level at which it can cover capital spending and dividends, is less than $50 per barrel. That is lower than current levels as well as our estimated midcycle prices of $60 per barrel.

Over the last 10 years, Exxon has grown the dividend about 8% per year, but growth in recent years has slowed with the decline in oil prices. While Exxon is unlikely to match peers' cash returns via share buybacks, we estimate it will continue to prioritize dividend growth. As such, we expect dividend growth to reaccelerate in the next few years with growth of midsingle-digits, closer to historical levels.

Christine Benz: Hi, I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar.com. The S&amp;P 500 has lost 7% over the past three months and many growth-leaning mutual funds have lost more than that. Joining me to discuss some of the biggest leaders and laggards amid this stretch of volatile performance is Russ Kinnel. He is director of manager research for Morningstar.

Russ, thank you so much for being here.

Russ Kinnel: Glad to be here.

Benz: Russ, let's start with the headlines. When you look at the categories, the diversified, domestic equity fund categories, which have suffered the most in this period of market volatility?

Kinnel: Well, from the three-month perspective, small growth has been hit the hardest. It's down about 14%. Large growth is down about 10%. And as you know, over the last few years, growth has been the best performing area. I take that at least some of that must be just simply a little correction, that they have had such a nice runup, very high expectations. In that way, it makes sense that they might correct the most.

Benz: Has the opposite side of the style box performed relatively better during this period?

Kinnel: That's right. Large value has lost the least. It's down about 6%, which is a big improvement on the growth side. I think some of that is simply that value has been the underperforming area and therefore maybe better set up to lose less in this kind of environment.

Benz: Of course, technology stocks have been kind of ground zero for this recent market volatility. So, I guess, it stands to reason that value funds would have less of some of those companies.

Kinnel: That's right. The FAANGs and some other tech areas have really been hit hard. And so, naturally, value funds tend to have very little exposure to the more aggressive side of tech. They might have some tech, but not the really fast-moving ones.

Benz: Let's talk about foreign stocks. Sometimes when U.S. markets sell off, we see that foreign stocks fall further still. What's been the pattern this time around?

Kinnel: In this case, the foreign equity sell-off has really mirrored what we saw in the U.S. So, pretty comparable performance. The first half of the year was not nearly as good for foreign equity funds; year-to-date, they are down significantly more than the U.S. This later sell-off hasn't been worse. But for the year, it has been worse.

Benz: When we look at sector fund performance, we talked about how the technology sector has been the hardest-hit area. Any other areas of note in terms of performing particularly well or poorly during this time frame?

Kinnel: Energy has been another area that's been hit hard. On the positive side, it's really the defensive areas that generally expect to do well, but it doesn't always work that way, but this time it has in that we are seeing utilities have held up the best. Some other defensive, high-quality consumer names have held up really nicely. It's actually kind of fitting, the basic idea, which is, defensive high-quality names that are slower growth, hold up well and the higher-risk names have sold off.

Benz: We often tell investors to hold bond funds to be a stable portion of their portfolio when we have these equity market shocks. Have they been a good place to be? Have bond funds generally delivered for investors during this time frame?

Kinnel: Only sort of. They have been less bad. Most bond funds have lost about 1% over the trailing three months. In a way, diversification does work but not maybe as well as you'd hope. Bond funds seem to be under pressure. We have a growing deficit, talk of inflation, and that's put pressure on the bond market.

Benz: Have there been safer spots to be within the bond fund space? Shorter-term and higher-quality, I would assume, may have held up a little bit better?

Kinnel: Yeah. Shorter-term and higher-quality has held up a little better in general. We are seeing longer bond sell off the most. So, they have done a little bit better, yes.

Benz: You looked through the performance rankings at some funds that have performed especially poorly during this stretch of weak market performance. Oakmark Select was one that you noted had particularly poor performance recently. What's going on there?

Kinnel: The fund is down about 15% over the trailing three months, and the reason is energy. Bill Nygren has been dialing up his exposure there, and unfortunately, so far, the timing has been bad and that's really stung the fund.

Benz: Fidelity Growth Company, probably not surprising to see that it has struggled recently. It tends to be really heavy on technology stocks, right?

Kinnel: Yes, it's made its shareholders a lot of money with tech stocks. But occasionally, you have to give some of that back. The fund has got a lot in FAANGs; it's got a lot in Nvidia. So, it's taken a rough stretch the last three months; it's lost about 16%.

Benz: You also pointed out some funds that have held up pretty well over this period. I was surprised to see Templeton Global Bond on that list, because it's a volatile fund, sometimes does worse other bond funds in periods of turbulence. What's going on there?

Kinnel: Templeton Global Bond is, as you say, much higher risk than most bond funds because they have got a lot of emerging-markets and currency risk involved. But in this case, where they've been very cautious is on duration. The fund actually has a negative duration, meaning, it actually benefits from rising rates. So, that's helped a lot. It's got a lot of emerging-markets exposure as well. That's been kind of a mixed bag, but better than a lot of other areas. It's actually been a nice performer.

Benz: On the equity side, quality has held up well. So, I guess, it's not surprising that you'd see a fund like Yacktman do relatively well during this time frame.

Kinnel: That's right. Yacktman has an emphasis on quality companies like Procter &amp; Gamble, and those names have really held up well. It also has a big cash stake and, of course, cash does well in a bear market. It's nice to see Yacktman having a rebound. It's another of those funds that's had a rough go of it for a while, but again, we understand the reasons, and this is sort of a proof of concept to see it looking good in a down market.

Benz: Any other funds that kind of stand out to you in terms of having delivered strong performance during this rough stretch?

Kinnel: Merger Fund is a fund that's up about 2.5% over the three months. It's one you kind of expect because it's doing merger arbitrage, it's strategy that is designed to not move with the markets because they are essentially long the acquisition target and short the acquirer. It's really what you'd expect. But it's nice to see it delivering. These kinds of market-neutral type funds have not had much of a chance to deliver in this very strong bull market. So, it's nice to see Merger Fund have its day in the sunshine.

Benz: Useful recap, Russ. Thank you so much for being here to share your insights.

Kinnel: You're welcome.

Benz: Thanks for watching. I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar.com.</content>

    <content type="text">The market-wide sell-off in equities during the fourth quarter has disproportionally impacted growth stocks that possess high price-to-earnings multiples translating into rich valuations. The market appears to have lost its appetite for the high growth and steep valuation equities that had huge upward moves throughout this record-setting bull market. HealthEquity Inc. (HQY) continues to post quarter after double-digit quarter growth in revenue and EPS and has been rewarded with a rich valuation as a function of its impressive growth. This high price-to-earnings multiple may be in jeopardy as the market moves into a risk-averse environment. As high-flying equities come down in the broader market sell-off, Health Equity may come down as a result and erase some of its monster gains that were witnessed in 2018. To be clear, Health Equity is an intermediary servicing the secular growth Health Savings Account (HSA) space thatâs largely independent of legislative actions, drug pricing, rising insurance costs and not playing any role in the pharmaceutical supply chain. HealthEquity manages funds allocated for medical, dental and vision expenses that are deducted on a pre-tax basis and deposited into a dedicated HSA account. The company blew out the numbers when it reported its Q3 FY19 results and beat on both the top and bottom line. 
 
HealthEquity manages $7.1 billion in assets across 3.7 million accounts against a potential market maturity of $1 trillion in assets across 50-60 million accounts. The durability of this growth has a long runway due to the secular growth in the HSA market. The company is sitting on largely untapped revenue sources where the vast majority of account holders have yet to invest any HSA money in investment offerings. Expanding margins for greater profitability is also unfolding as the older the account, the greater the gross margins. HealthEquity is currently sitting on a healthy balance sheet with $330 million in cash and cash equivalents with no debt. The company is posting accelerating revenue, cash flow, margin expansion and income growth with a strong balance sheet. I feel that HealthEquity will continue to post strong growth as it services the double-digit HSA growth market and manages more assets, accounts, and investments within these accounts. HealthEquity may be a great long-term investment in the healthcare space thatâs independent of the health insurances, pharmaceutical supply chain companies, drug makers or pharmacies. Previously , I warned that the âcurrent valuation is rich in an already frothy market thus caution at these levels is wiseâ and now it appears this heeding was responsible as the stock has sold off from $101 to $74 shedding 26% of its market value during the fourth quarter. Health Equity looks compelling after this healthy correction as the long-term narrative remains intact.  
 HealthEquityâs FY19 Q3 Earnings  
Q3 FY19 earnings delivered another double-digit growth story across the board with revenue coming in at $70.5 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Net income came in at $15.7 million, an increase of 50% year-over-year. Total HSA members came in at 3.7 million, an increase of 22% compared to Q3 FY18. Total custodial assets were $7.1 billion, an increase of 27% compared to year-over-year (Figure 1). 
 
âHealthEquity delivered robust third-quarter results, strengthening our momentum going into the important fourth quarter and year-end,â said Jon Kessler, President, and CEO of HealthEquity. âBy adding more than $1.5 billion in additional custodial assets since the end of our third quarter last year, our growth continues well ahead of the market, allowing us to raise guidance for the fiscal year 2019. Importantly, with custodial investment assets growing by 53% over the third quarter ended last year, we are delivering on our promise to help our HSA members connect health and wealth and put them on the fast track to retirement readiness.â 
 
The company is in a very healthy financial position and had $330.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and no outstanding debt. Total custodial assets were $7.1 billion, an increase of 27% year-over-year which is broken out into custodial cash assets of $5.6 billion, an increase of 22% and custodial investment assets of $1.5 billion, an increase of 53%. The latter will serve as a major growth driver as an untapped revenue source. Weâre witnessing early adoption of this revenue source now that $1.5 billion is allocated in investment assets. Collectively, these great financial metrics have translated into fantastic stock performance over the past year with the stock nearly tripling until the recent market wide sell-off (Figure 2).

 Future Growth and Healthcare Cost Containment Play  
HealthEquity is one of the major players in the HSA secular growth market and has continued to gain market share over the years. Currently, HealthEquity manages $7.1 billion in assets across 3.7 million accounts against a potential market maturity of $1 trillion in assets across 50-60 million accounts. The company currently has 15% market share in a number of accounts and custodial assets. HealthEquity has been growing market share with plenty of market expansion ahead of itself. Assuming a 15% penetration in both a number of accounts and assets, HealthEquityâs maturity may come in at 8.25 million accounts and $150 billion in custodial assets, respectively (Figure 1). 
 
HSAs are becoming an invaluable option for consumers to contain medical costs and take control of healthcare spending. High Deductible Health Plans (HDHP) coupled with HSAs contained family plan deductibles at a far lower level than any other healthcare plan. HDHPs have a 10-year CARG deductible of only 2.8% while the HMO model comes in at 8.2% over the same period. Additionally, funds deposited in the companion HSA account can be invested into mutual fund options to grow these funds over time. At age 65 these funds can be withdrawn without penalty at your effective rate, effectively serving as a second 401k over time. This dual-purpose account serves as a great means to contain healthcare costs while building wealth via investments over the long term.

 Untapped Revenue Sources and Margin Expansion  
HealthEquity is posting accelerating revenue, cash flow, and income growth. The company is sitting on untapped revenue sources and plenty of room for margin expansion. Regarding untapped revenue sources, of the 3.7 million members, 96% of account holders have yet to invest any money within its HSA accounts. This serves as an untapped pool of money that can invested in various mutual funds while HealthEquity collects a small fraction of the dollar amounts invested in these investment accounts as management fees. Considering that the average age of an account is only 3.5 years and over 41% have been open for two years or less, this provides ample opportunity for future penetration in this investment space. Given the fact that these account balances are correlated with age translates into more probability that any surplus will be invested to drive account value further. As the company continues to grow, the float of HSA funds is expanding at a rapid clip year-over-year in a rising interest rate environment which only contributes to bottom line revenue to underpin the business. 
 Summary  
HealthEquity Inc. (HQY) has continued its path of accelerating revenue, cash flow and income growth across all segments of its business in the backdrop of an HSA secular growth market. Despite these great financial metrics, throughout the fourth quarter, the market has become risk-averse, and many high growth names have been met with correction territory. HealthEquity is no exception and has seen over 25% of its market capitalization erased. HealthEquity looks compelling after this healthy correction as the long-term narrative remains intact. The company is debt-free and expanding its balance sheet with just over $330 million in cash and cash equivalents. HealthEquity currently manages $7.1 billion in assets across 3.8 million accounts against a potential market maturity of $1 trillion in assets across 50-60 million accounts. The company is sitting on untapped revenue sources, and gross margin expansion is beginning to bear fruit as accounts age and more funds are channeled into investment vehicles. HealthEquity is continuing to post strong growth as it expands the number of accounts, manages more custodial assets, expands gross margins and more accounts transitioning into investment vehicles. Furthermore, HSAs are serving as a dual purpose as a healthcare containment play while serving as a second 401k as assets can be withdrawn in retirement without plenty fueling the popularity of these accounts.

Bringing Down the House on Intellectual Property and Access 

As the Trump administration makes noise aboutÂ  the high price of pharmaceuticals while doubling down on its commitment to âprotect the engine of American ingenuity,â this issue of TAGline dives deep into the rhetoric and realities of intellectual propertyÂ  (IP)Â  protectionsÂ  andÂ  the current wave of political shenanigans on critical drugs, surfacing the fundamental lies and vested interests that deny medication to those in need in the United States and around the world.

          This Weekâs Diagnosis  
Memorial services for President George H.W. Bush were held this week in Washington, DC and Texas. No agreement has been reached on border wall funding, which means Members may be here through at least December 21. 
 Congress   
Continuing Resolution is the Short-term Solution. Congressional leaders decided to limit votes this week to attend the memorial services for President George H. W. Bush, delaying consideration of an omnibus appropriations bill to fund the remainder of the federal agencies beyond December 7. The extension to December 21, 2018, provides additional time to reach an agreement, but also sets the stage for a pre-holiday government shutdown negotiation. 
   
Future of the Finance Committee. Â Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), the incoming Chairman and current Ranking Democrat of the Senate Finance Committee, respectively, introduced a bill this week that attempts to close a loophole in the Medicaid drug rebate program. TheÂ  Right Rebate Act Â would give Medicaid more tools to conduct oversight and impose financial penalties on drug companies that knowingly misclassify drugs as generic (as opposed to brand name) in order to receive rebates on the drug. This legislation is significant for two reasons. First, it is a bipartisan bill addressing a piece of the prescription drug cost puzzle. Second, those Senators will be the new leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, and this bill signals not only their first collaborative endeavor since the election (indicating this is a priority for both men), but also their willingness and ability to work together in the new Congress. 
  Administration   
More Work Requirements for Medicaid Approved. Â The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved New Hampshireâs work requirements waiver request this week. New Hampshire expanded Medicaid in 2014, but Republicans in the state legislature have been pushing for work requirements ever since. New Hampshire is the fourth state to secure approval from CMS to impose work requirements for certain Medicaid recipients. 
   
White House Releases Report on Healthcare Competition. Â The US Departments of Health and Human Services, Treasury and Labor released a joint report this week, â Reforming Americaâs Healthcare System Through Choice and Competition ,â highlighting the role of state and federal laws and regulations on choice and competition in health care markets. The report identifies actions that states and the federal government could take to address some identified roadblocks, restating a number of already advanced Administration priorities, including improving transparency and loosening restrictive regulations. The reportâs recommendations provide a roadmap for other policy changes likely to be championed by the the Administration in 2019. 
   
FDA Makes Changes to De Novo Pathway for Devices . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released aÂ  proposed ruleÂ  that would change the review process (known as âde novoâ pathway) for new, lower-risk medical devices for which there are no similar devices on the market. This proposal would attempt to bring more transparency and efficiency to the application and review process â something the device industry has sought. As a result of these changes, the FDA anticipates more developers will use the de novo pathway. This comes on the heels of FDA changes to the 510(k) pathway (the alternative to the de novo). The proposed rule is currently open for public comment. 
   
CMS Finalizes Risk Adjustment Rule for Exchange Plans.Â  CMS issued aÂ  final rule Â adopting the HHS-operated risk adjustment methodology for the 2018 benefit year. Last February, a federal judge in New Mexico ruled that the government had failed to justify its methodology for calculating risk adjustment payments for the 2014 to 2018 benefit years. The administration used that ruling as the basis for freezing payments for a short time in July. CMS then announced a final rule to resume the payments for the 2017 benefit year, readopting the existing methodology and adding an explanation of the programâs budget neutrality and use of statewide average premiums. A similar fix for 2018 was proposed shortly thereafter. The final rule is intended to provide some stability for issuers. However, with multiple ACA-related lawsuits winding their way through the courts, predictability remains elusive. The final rule comes out during the open enrollment period, and amidst what appears to be a downturn in ACA enrollment across the federal exchange states. 
  Other   
GAO Report on Review of Orphan Drug Program. Â The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued aÂ  reportÂ  on the FDAâs orphan drug program. The report specifically examined the growth of the program, the use of consistent criteria in evaluating applications and steps taken to address rare disease drug development challenges. The report notes a number of stakeholder concerns, including the strength of the incentives and the high price of these drugs once they hit the market. This report may trigger hearings and further inquiries from Congress. 
  MedPAC Examines Adequacy of Medicare Payment. Â The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) held itsÂ  December meeting . Commissioners heard reports on payment adequacy for services across Medicare, including physicians and other health professionals, ambulatory surgical centers, and hospital inpatient and outpatient. MedPAC also examined hospital quality incentive programs and provided a status report on Medicare Advantage. The presentations highlighted focus areas for potential policy recommendations in the future, including discussion about eliminating incident to billing; examining coding intensity in Medicare Advantage; and eliminating an update in 2020 and requiring costs reports for ambulatory surgery centers.  Next Weekâs Dose  
âNormalâ order returns to the Hill next week, with both chambers back in session feverishly working toward wrapping up any outstanding legislation and the ever-elusive deal on border wall funding. Smell jet fumes anyone?</content>

    <content type="text">One of the most powerful people in the next Congress will be a 15-term congressman from New Jersey, poised to become head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that has jurisdiction over key issues including energy, environment and health. Rep. Frank PalloneÂ  joins Senior Correspondent David Cruz. 
 
Cruz: So you were a freshman in, what, 1988? 
 
Pallone: Yes. 
 
Cruz: This is probably the most interesting time that youâve had in Congress, just in terms of the craziness that is America today, no? 
 
Pallone: I would agree. I think it is a very crazy and tough time, yes. 
 
Cruz: What do you think of this freshman class? 
 
Pallone: Well I think itâs, you know, energizing for me because we have so many new Democrats who, you know, want to get things done, and care about the public and are raring to go. Ideologically, itâs a complete spectrum, from some that are much more conservative and some that are very liberal and left-wing, and I think it kind of reflects the Democratic Party because we are a big spectrum. 
 
Cruz: Even in the New Jersey delegation, right? Youâve got all the way to the left â Iâd say maybe [Andy] Kim would be sort of the leftist of the bunch? 
 
Pallone: No, I would think that of the new members, I think are more, I would say, moderate. You know, in our delegation. I mean, I consider myself a liberal. I think I would be to the left of all the new members. 
 
Cruz: Iâm saying out of that new bunch, the most liberal would have been Kim, would you think? 
 
Pallone: I canât categorize them. I think theyâre all pretty moderate. You know, they ran in districts that lean Republican. I think they were very careful to say that they want to work on a bipartisan basis, and I would say theyâre very centrist, all four. 
 
Cruz: Now you say that the Democratic Party is this big tent, which is its strength, but itâs also its potential weakness, right? 
 
Pallone: Yes. 
 
Cruz: Because sometimes the inter-party squabbles are the ones that hurt the most. 
 
Pallone: That is true. When you have a group that are very widespread in their ideology, sometimes itâs hard to get a consensus. But I do think itâs better to have that, because itâs more of a strength than a weakness. 
 
Cruz: Is it your sense that the party runs that risk, now that itâs in the majority, in the House at least? 
 
Pallone: Everybody ran on this âbetter dealâ proposal, which was essentially our message. And I think that the âbetter dealâ is a pretty centrist message and contrasts with Trump, and you know, the right-wing on the Republican side. You know, things like stabilize the Affordable Care Act so that insurance is affordable, a major infrastructure initiative, addressing climate change because we have to do something about, you know, increase in greenhouse gases.Â  I think itâs a type of agenda that we put forth that elected a majority that you can really sell anywhere in the country. 
 
Cruz: What do you think youâll be able to work with the president on? I mean, from the very beginning heâs talked about a major infrastructure initiative that has gone in and out of style over these first two years, and here would be a perfect opportunity for a president who may want to work something out with a part of the legislative body that is with the other party. 
 
Pallone: I totally agree with you 100 percent. 
 
Cruz: Can you get that done with him? 
 
Pallone: I think so. And I mean, I think the easiest thing to get done â and I donât say itâs easy â is an infrastructure vote, because essentially the president was trying to push it. But the Republican leadership didnât want to pay for it, in the sense that they didnât want to use federal dollars. And part of the reason for that was when they passed their tax bill, or their tax, you know, initiative, that they created a huge deficit of money. That deficit could have been used to pay for the infrastructure bill, so then they came back to President Trump and said, âWell, weâll do it but it has to be paid for with state and private money,â which doesnât work. It just doesnât exist. 
 
Cruz: Right. And if youâre going, you know, keep spending money to try to build a wall and all those other priorities, then whereâs the money going to come from for this infrastructure? 
 
Pallone: Absolutely. 
 
Cruz: We should say that the the wall at the southern border is not considered an infrastructure project right now. 
 
Pallone: No, and even a lot of Republicans, as you know, think that the wall would be a huge waste of money and totally ineffective, you know. 
 
Cruz: How do you now approach this president in a different position now, as a majority? 
 
Pallone: Well, I think what we have to do is, you know, we put forward some ideas â infrastructure initiative would be one. Another would be another thing that Trump championed, and still does, is trying to lower the cost of prescription drugs. He came out in favor of negotiated prices under Medicare, and you know, initiatives that would encourage generics to create competition, so thatâs another thing. In our committee â Energy and Commerce Committee, where Iâll be the chair beginning in January â weâll try to do a major infrastructure bill. Weâll try to do negotiated prices under Medicare and some generic initiatives and see if we can get the Republicans in the Senate to say, look the president supports this, so why donât you go along with him? 
 
Cruz: Last question, is Nancy Pelosi the leader for this, the right person for the job? 
 
Pallone: Absolutely. I think you know that we had our caucus and she was elected as the Speaker-designate. 
 
Cruz: With less of a fight than everybody thought there was going to be. 
 
Pallone: Yeah, I mean the problem is that on â and thatâs why it keeps being discussed â is that on Jan. 3 when weâre sworn in, the speaker has to get 218 votes. But I think she will, so I think sheâll be fine.

    <content type="text">A new proposal could reduce Delaware seniorsâ pharmacy bills 
 
Delawareans spend lots on prescription drugs. Each year, the average resident spends about $1,500 on them, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Seniors face particularly high and unpredictable costs, since they generally need more medications than younger folks. 
 
Fortunately, a new proposal from the Department of Health and Human Services could significantly reduce out-of-pocket expenses for people enrolled in Medicare Part D, the federal prescription drug benefit. 
 
Today, more than 125,000 Delawareans are enrolled in Part D, which provides federally-subsidized drug coverage to seniors and some people with disabilities. Delawareans can choose from among 21 plans. Most of those plans require seniors to pay a deductible, a monthly premium, and a portion of a drugâs cost, either by a copay or through coinsurance. 
 
HHS is pushing three key reforms to reduce seniorsâ out-of-pocket spending. 
 
The first would require private insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to share drug discounts with patients. 
 
Insurers hire pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, to administer their drug plans. In this position, PBMs help design drug formularies and cost-sharing arrangements â so can generally secure deep discounts from drug makers. 
 
But few of these discounts trickle down to patients at the drugstore. 
 
HHS wants to require insurers to share a portion of these discounts with beneficiaries at the pharmacy counter. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that passing along even a third of the discounts would save beneficiaries more than $19 billion over the next decade. 
 
The second policy would create an out-of-pocket spending cap of $5,000 in Part D. 
 
Right now, for most Part D plans, enrollees pay for all of their medical expenses out of pocket until they reach their deductible. In 2018, the maximum deductible is $405 
 
After that, beneficiaries enter a second phase of coverage, where they and their insurer share the cost of medications until spending reaches $3,750. After this, consumers enter the âdonut holeâ phase of coverage â and pay a higher percentage of their drugsâ costs than before. 
 
Once they spend $5,000 out of pocket, their cost-sharing obligations decline to about 5 percent of their drug spending â and Medicare picks up most, but not all, the rest. 
 
However, even small amounts of cost sharing in the catastrophic phase can add up, especially if beneficiaries are very sick and need advanced treatments. An out-of-pocket spending cap would ease the financial burden on beneficiaries who are already facing physical health crises. 
 
The third reform would make generic drugs free for beneficiaries enrolled in âExtra Help,â a special program within Part D that sharply reduces premiums and copays for low-income enrollees. Right now, single households that earn less than $18,210 and couples with household incomes of less than $24,690 are eligible. Here in Delaware, about one in four Part D beneficiaries is eligible for the program. 
 
Thanks to the reform, these beneficiaries would no longer have a co-pay on generic drugs. That may not sound like much, since the program already caps these co-pays at $3.35. But many enrollees require multiple prescriptions to manage chronic conditions like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Saving even $10 a month could significantly improve low-income seniorsâ financial security. 
 
Part D is already tremendously popular with seniors, boasting an approval rating of more than 85 percent. These three HHS reforms would make the program even stronger by trimming seniorsâ out-of-pocket spending at the pharmacy.

    <content type="text">A white paper by Health Strategies Group, an Eversana company. Eversana is the leading independent provider of global services to the life sciences industry. 
 
Health and Human Services has proposed to rescind the anti-kickback safe harbors in Medicare 
 
In July, HHS submitted a proposed rule called âRemoval of Safe Harbor Protection for Rebates to Plans or PBMs Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe Harbor Protectionâ to the Office of Management of Budget for review. The proposal would upend the Part D drug access negotiations between biopharmaceutical companies and Medicare payers and intermediaries. Language from the proposal has not been made public and review time for OMB is undefined. 
 
The proposal to eliminate Medicare rebates will likely face numerous obstacles including questions of regulatory and legal authority to enact the proposed changes, stakeholder concerns, and possible lengthy litigation of any final rule. While general attention is currently focused on the complex process this policy change faces, pharmaceutical companies should be focusing on leveraging the opportunities and mitigating the risks this change could create. It is vitally important for companies to understand the potential impact on MA-PD and PDP payers as well as Medicare beneficiaries. 
 
Despite the uncertainty of final policy details, one thing is clear: this administration is committed to making significant changes to the Medicare program with consequences that will impact relationships among all Part D stakeholders. 
 
Potential Medicare Rebate Outcomes 
 
While predicting the future is difficult, the current policy discussion can help us anticipate responses from key stakeholders and examine implications for the biopharmaceutical industry. There are three consistent themes in the current debate that suggest possible outcomes: 
 
â¢ Improve cost transparency to create price competition 
â¢ Eliminate intermediaries and their impact on cost 
â¢ Increase consumer participation in decision making 
 
Building on these three themes, several distinct scenarios describe the future marketplace and allow the industry to assess the impact on primary stakeholders: MA-PD, PDPs, and Medicare participants. While most Medicare payers expect insurmountable barriers to prevent a wholesale elimination of rebates, they do anticipate changes to how Medicare pricing and access are determined. With any of these proposals, however, payers and intermediaries will need to redefine the roles they play in formulary negotiations. 
 
Potential Impact on Medicare Payers 
 
Currently, there is lack of cohesive response from PDPs and MA-PDs. An unclear picture of the specific replacement creates significant uncertainty. Regardless of preparation, PDPs in particular bear the greatest exposure to negative outcomes with many of the changes, while MA-PDs can adjust. The key risks/opportunities that payers face in any scenario are: 
 
â¢ Increased financial risk exposure with loss of rebates 
â¢ Change in the business model and shift in role to a transactional manager and need to create new value proposition 
â¢ Engagement with Healthcare providers will evolve to support patients and create new models to manage product selection 
â¢ Value message conveyed to Medicare beneficiaries will move to outcomes and engagement for payers to retain a strong role 
 
1. The greatest adjustment for Medicare payers will involve the impact of lost rebates on their financial risk management strategy. Without rebates and with no control over net cost, they will be forced to rapidly adopt aggressive management solutions. Likely tools will include: 
 
â¢ Limited formularies based upon list price 
â¢ Increased use of administrative restrictions such as step therapy, prior authorization, or more aggressive cost share designs 
â¢ Relationships with pharma and healthcare providers that share risk or provide incentives to drive cost and outcomes 
 
2. PDPs could see their business model change radically, particularly with the elimination of rebates or the shift to discounts directly credited to the patient at point-of-sale. In this model the PDP will become merely a transactional adjudicator and will be forced to create inventive value propositions or face rapid commoditization. Potential alternatives include growth in value or outcomes-based population programs, enhanced patient engagement, or the addition of ancillary services for patients, like disease management. This model opens opportunities to new entrants into the market, such as Amazon, who are not required to build complex rebate and risk management solutions while providing a wide array of ancillary services. 
 
3. For both PDP and MA-PD businesses, the immediate response to managing increased risk will be to engage providers. Engagement may range from improved decision-making tools with real-time benefit and cost solutions at point of prescribing, to incentives to encourage preferred drug use, to risk-sharing arrangements. Currently, however, HCPs are not equipped to apply these advanced models. While there are some sophisticate IDNs that have the infrastructure necessary to participate, the cost to these systems will likely exceed the financial opportunity. PDPs in particular will be challenged to build risk models because the potential for pharmacy-related losses in the outpatient setting can escalate quickly without proper design. 
 
As the Trump administration exerts more oversight over the healthcare industry, Medicare is a primary target. Already, CMS has begun to make incremental Part B and D benefit design changes and bigger, more impactful modifications are on the horizon. 
 
Seniors Response to Rebates Changes Could Affect Terms 
 
Seniors are notoriously resistant to changes in the Medicare benefits they currently receive. Confusion about the potential effects of such change may cause seniors to mobilize politically to ensure the benefits they experience are not altered. Medicare stakeholders should be prepared to provide support to seniors to allay their fears. Seniors could experience varied changes based on which rebate outcomes are achieved, and their expressions of frustration will pressure to CMS to rapidly invest in outreach and education. 
There are several areas where seniors could seek support from Medicare stakeholders: 
 
Implications to the Biopharmaceutical Industry 
 
With all three of these proposals, the biopharmaceutical industry will be forced to rethink its overall drug pricing strategies. Multiple companies competitively bidding on price could create a zero-sum game of price reductions in highly competitive categories. Even if rebates remain, transparency would force more scrutiny over drug list price. 
 
With this in mind, pharmaceutical companies should consider several courses of action: 
 
1. Define a strategy for Medicare access that moves beyond price discounts. In crowded classes, brands will see aggressive pricing that could result in significantly lower net prices. To create and maintain brand loyalty, companies will need to build strategies to engage consumers, providers, and other stakeholders. 
 
2. Selectively build value-based contracting arrangements to establish a competitive edge where possible. A shift toward these types of relationships is inevitable in the Medicare program, and identifying new arrangements early can move negotiations beyond pricing in areas where value is important, such as CV, oncology, and other high cost areas. 
 
3. Develop value-add programs for access, like population health management tools, in order to share in the new additional risk Medicare payers are taking on. This provides an opportunity for payers and pharmaceutical companies to build relationships with consumers and a reliance on long-term treatment. 
 
4. Assess implications for physicians and offer potential support as payers begin to contemplate additional risk-sharing relationships with HCPs who are unprepared for new tools. POS benefit verification, in particular, would allow physicians to verify benefits and net cost before they write the script. This approach aligns with value-based outcomes models and supports population health efforts. 
 
5. Rapidly scale claims adjudication and point-of-sale capabilities. Direct discounting to consumers, while ensuring full coverage of insured benefits, will be a complex process that will require advanced claims management capabilities. 
 
6. Work with newly developing third parties who are thinking about healthcare delivery in multiple new ways. Formulary support tools, for example, can help seniors navigate new benefits and understand costs at point of service. Embracing these tools can allow innovative companies to reach out to consumers in a new way with new technologies and advancements.

    <content type="text">Recently, Congress enacted the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, or the âSUPPORT Act,â to further address the nationâs opioid epidemic. However, included in the SUPPORT Act is a wholesale expansion of kickback prohibitions which will have a far-reaching effect on the healthcare industry â and in particular, laboratories. The Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (EKRA) provision is an all-payor statute that prohibits kickbacks related to referrals made to laboratories, recovery homes, and clinical treatment facilities (non-hospital medical settings that provide detoxification, risk reduction, outpatient treatment and care, residential treatment, or rehabilitation for substance use). 
 
EKRA prohibits any solicitation or payment in exchange for patient referrals or to induce the referral of an individual to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility or laboratory. Unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, EKRA applies to all healthcare benefit programs, including private payors. While EKRA provides certain exceptions, those exceptions are not as inclusive as the safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Violations of EKRA can result in criminal prosecution with fines of up to $200,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both. 
 
With the passage of EKRA, laboratories, clinical treatment facilities, and recovery homes should immediately consider reviewing all financial arrangements with healthcare providers, contractors and employees who are in a position to generate referrals â including marketing personnel and sales reps. 
 
Absent an exception, EKRA prohibits any person or entity from knowingly and willingly offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving, directly or indirectly, anything of value: (1) in return for referring a patient or patronage to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory; or (2) to induce a referral of an individual to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory; or (3) in exchange for an individual using a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratoryâs services. EKRAâs prohibition is broad, and affected providers in the industry should review the statute for compliance purposes. For example, the common industry practice of paying laboratory sales reps based on the volume or value of lab tests generated for the laboratory (when the test is paid by a commercial/private payor) will now subject laboratories to heightened scrutiny, and could be found to violate EKRA. 
 
EKRA provides several exceptions that protect certain arrangements, specifically: 
  
A properly disclosed and notated discount or other reduction in price under a healthcare benefit program 
   
Payments to an employee or independent contractor that do not vary based on the number of individuals referred, the number of tests or procedures performed, or the amount billed to or reimbursed from a health care benefit program 
   
Drug discounts under the Medicare coverage gap discount program 
   
Payments made in compliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statuteâs personal services and management contracts safe harbor 
   
Non-routine, good-faith waivers or discounts of any coinsurance or copayment amount 
   
Arrangements with health center entities that serve medically underserved populations care if designed to increase availability or quality of services provided 
   
Alternative payment model payments or payments under an arrangement used by a state, health insurance issuer, or group health plan, if HHS determines it necessary for care-coordination or value-based care. 
   
One important distinction between the EKRA exceptions and the federal Anti-Kickback Statuteâs safe harbors is the absence of the Anti-Kickback Statuteâs employment safe harbor under EKRA. This means that previously compliant payment methodologies structured under the Anti-Kickback Statuteâs employment safe harbor (such as paying W-2 employees a volume or value based commission) are now at risk of violating EKRA. 
  
Congress included a pre-emption clause related to conduct prohibited by the Anti-Kickback Statute â âThis section shall not apply to conduct that is prohibited under [the Anti-Kickback Statute].â It appears as though Congress â through the inclusion of this pre-emption âis recognizing that it has taken concepts from the Anti-Kickback Statute and is applying them to all health care benefit plans, but it is otherwise not trying to affect claims falling under the jurisdiction of the Anti-Kickback Statute. In other words, âregular kickbacksâ under Medicare and Medicaid would continue to be governed solely by the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some commentators have questioned whether the word ânotâ should have been inserted before the word âprohibited,â or whether âprohibitedâ was intended to be the word âpermittedâ under the preemption clause. We think this is unlikely, and that it is more likely that Congress intended for this pre-emption to give clear instruction to the Department of Justice regarding the enforcement of EKRA when claims are also subject to Anti-Kickback Statute enforcement. 
 
If your laboratory or clinical treatment facility has financial relationships with providers or other referral sources, or contracts with or employs marketing agents who generate referrals for your company, you should consider reviewing those arrangements with counsel who is familiar with EKRA and healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse laws. It is likely that your company may be required to make substantial changes to its provider/agent/employee compensation methodologies. 
 
1 EKRA defines âhealth care benefit programâ consistent with 18 U.S.C. Â§ 24, which states that âhealth care benefit programâ means âany public or private plan or contract, affecting commerce, under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided to any individual, and includes any individual or entity who is providing a medical benefit, item, or service for which payment may be made under the plan or contract.â Thus, EKRA applies to private and public insurance plans.</content>

But behind those staggering figures was some fairly good news:Â The rate of growth slowed for the second year in a row, according to a report from economic experts at the federal Department of Health and Human Services. 
 
Health care spending increased by 3.9 percent in 2017, following a 4.8 percent increase in 2016.Â Private insurance spending grew more slowly in 2017, and so did Medicaid, while Medicare costs grew at about the same rate. 
 
If moderate growth can be maintained, that would make the U.S. health care system more manageable for families, employers and government.Â In recent years insurance coverage expansion under former President Barack Obama and large increases in prescription drug spending had led to faster growth.</content>

    <content type="text">Pharmaceutical mergers: Kill or cure?



Takeda's acquisition of Shire is Japan's biggest-ever foreign takeover

AS BEFITS A deal in the medical industry, this one has been rather hard to swallow. But on December 5th, eight months after Takeda, Japan's largest pharmaceutical firm, said it was interested in buying Shire, an Irish-headquartered drugmaker of a similar size, shareholders at last voted to approve the acquisition. The purchase will cost Takeda $56bn in cash and new shares. Since the initial news of the deal the firm's share price has fallen by 25%.

Takeda's acquisition is unusual. It is by far the largest foreign buy-out ever executed by a Japanese firm (even though the country's outbound merger-and-acquisition activity is surging). Nor was Shire considered a likely target. Acquiring firms usually seek new technologies or overlaps that allow cost-cutting. Shire does have a strong pipeline of new molecules, but the portfolio did not complement any large drugmakers' existing suite of drugs, including that of Takeda. Powerful domestic pressures are encouraging Japanese drugmakers to look abroad. An ageing population has put pressure on Japan's government-run health-care system, which accounts for two-fifths of the country's drug spending. The health ministry is hard at work promoting generic drugs and pushing down prices.

But few groups have taken as drastic action as 237-year-old Takeda, which in 2014 brought in as its leader a Frenchman, Christophe Weber. He has noted that Japan's drugs market is only 7% of the global one, and that "if we want to be successful, we have to be successful outside of Japan".

A slim pipeline of new drugs and fiercer competition also boded ill for Takeda's revenues. Slowing sales of Velcade, a cancer drug, were expected to wipe a fifth off its profits in the next few years. The firm had only two new drugs with blockbuster potential in late-stage clinical trials. Buying Shire does help there: the drugmaker earns two-thirds of its revenues in America and its portfolio of rare-disease drugs will bolster Takeda's revenues.

But the sheer size of the deal elicited resistance. A group of shareholders led by Kazuhisa Takeda, a descendant of the founding family and a former board director, and Shigeru Mishima, a former stockmarket analyst, was bitterly disappointed by this week's approval. On the question of why the group opposed the acquisition, Mr Mishima cites "risk, risk, risk!". Local rivals, Astellas and Daiichi Sankyo, which have chosen to make smaller acquisitions, of American biotechnology companies, have seen their shares rise by 18% and 43% respectively, as Takeda's have fallen.

The dissidents may have a point. Scope for cost-cutting is relatively limited. It will saddle the combined entity with $48bn of net debt, or over five times its expected annual operating earnings. To bring the huge cost of servicing this down, Mr Weber will have to dispose of promising products worth $5bn after the firms merge, on January 8th. He claims strong combined cashflow will help pay down debt quickly, but Shire's haemophilia drugs, worth a quarter of its revenues in 2017, are threatened by new drugs from other big pharma firms.

Mr Takeda and other dissident shareholders do not deny the company needs to diversify its range of products. Nor, they claim, are they against acquisitions or globalisation. But the dose makes the poison. Swallowing Shire could prove toxic.</content>

The event was hosted by The Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska (Tlingit &amp; Haida) as benefit for LingiÃ¬t (Tlingit) language teacher Mary Folletti DaaljÃ­ni and may be the first drag show sponsored by a tribal government.

This fall, Southeast Alaskaâs largest tribal organization hosted its first ever drag show, âBesties for Breastiesâ a fundraiser for Northwest coast artist Mary Follettiâs breastcancer treatment. Organized by Juneau Chilkat weaver and drag queen Ricky Tagan, the event helped promote inclusivity and acceptance of Two-Spirit community and may be the first of its kind. 
 
Language teacher Mary Folletti met Ricky Tagaban through a Tlingit immersion program at Sitkaâs Dog Point Fish Camp in the mid-2000s. 
 
Over the years the two artists have grown closer. 
 
âWe just developed from there,â Folletti said. 
 
âIâd call you for rides to dance practice,â Tagaban said. 
 
The two have collaborated on jewelry, and Tagaban has even helped raise Follettiâs children, weaving a prized Chilkat dance robe for her daughter Enza. 
 
In 2010, Tagaban was asked by the late master weaver Clarissa Rizal to study Chilkat weaving, a tradition practiced solely by women, itâs unusual, but because of his gender identity heâs invited to participate. Heâs Two Spirit, defined by an Indigenous person of a third gender containing both male and female spirits.

One way he expresses this side of himself, is through drag â where performers blur the lines of gender by donning clothing and embodying characteristics the opposite sex. Tagaban has been exploring this connection of his Indigenous and queer identities through his feminine persona, Lituya Hart, named after the ancestral grounds of his clan at Lituya Bay 
 
âCause with the name Lituya, I always brought my Tlingit self with me,â Tagaban said. âLike thatâs always just there.â 
 
Tagaban has performed internationally as Lituya, wove Chilkat in high heels at the Anchorage Museum, and brought her to the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center in Honolulu. 
 
âEven if I donât look Native to people, even if Iâm not doing something fiercely traditional all the time, you know I could be doing a pop song, but Iâm still Tlingit,â Tagaban said. 
 
Last year, Folletti was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer following the birth of her son Carver. Her family set up an online crowdfunding campaign and hosted events to help with the cost of treatment. But the idea to raise money with a drag show, came from Follettiâs wife, Roz Cruise. She knew her coworkers at Tlingit and Haida wanted to host an event, so she suggested it to the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, southeast Alaskaâs tribal government. The proposal came to the desk of Richard Peterson who serves as President of Tlingit &amp; Haida. 
 
âWelly, you know, usually we stick to auctions and Indian Tacos, so this is a little different,â Peterson said. âIâve never been to a drag show, so this will be new to me.â 
 
Peterson believes Two Spirit people have always existed and played an important spiritual role in Tlingit Culture. 
 
âThereâs enough that divides us, and so you know I always think about people who already feel marginalized and then you have something that differentiates them you know, more, you know instead of putting that down, letâs celebrate what makes us different and unique,â Peterson said.

The event may be the first drag show to be sponsored by a tribal government. (Photo by Annie Bartholomew/KTOO)  
But Peterson says the council isnât trying to make a statement or be the first tribe to host a drag show. Itâs about upholding a family and supporting all of its tribal citizens. 
 
âYou know, Maryâs dedicated her life to our culture, to language. Sheâs a part of that âLanguage Warriorâ group thatâs revitalizing our languages,â Peterson said. âI think sometimes we gotta warrior up for our warriors. We gotta hold her up right now.â 
 
The all-ages drag show, âBesties for Breastiesâ took place in Juneauâs Elizabeth Peratrovich Hall with an audience of tribal members, elders and non-native community support. 
 
Dancing to a song by First Nations DJ Collective group A Tribe Called Red, Lituya Hart took the stage in six-inch sparkly heels. 
 
âI had this denim cape thatâs shaped like a Chilkat blanket, and I sprayed kind of graffiti Formline on it,â Tagaban said. âSo it has a lot of elements of a Chilkat blanket, like the border but with rhinestones and all the fringe is that plastic tubing thatâs really pretty with a rainbow pattern.â 
 
Tagaban floated along the catwalk, gracefully dancing in the traditional style, before stepping out of his heels and thrashing across stage. In a blinged out Shakee.Ã¡t headress, Tagaban released down feathers onto the crowd like snowflakes, leaving to give hugs and collect dollar bills from the audience.

âI couldnât see much from the crowd but people have told me that people around them just started crying, like crying was like the first response,â Tagaban said. âA lot of men stormed the stage and were dumping money into the buckets. Which I donât know if thatâs their version of crying or approving but I thought it was well received. 
 
The fundraiser raised nearly $8,000 for Folettiâs family. 
 
âIn my mind, everyone should do something like this,â Tagaban said. âLike in 20 years we see Yupâik drag queens, Yupâik dancing in drag and Inupiat and Deniana and Gwichâin and Sugpiaq, and Unanganx,â 
 
This spring Tagaban won a Rasmuson Individual artist award for his work, and hopes that this is just the beginning. And that one day, this kind of expression will just be normal.</content>

    <content type="text">MEDICARE POLICY

As a Medicare recipient, I was intrigued by your front-page story "Trump sets off Medicare frenzy" (Nov. 25). As I read the article, it appears insurers, hospitals, drug manufacturers and some doctors are asking for regulatory relief from Medicare rules enacted decades ago in a very different health care environment. At the same time, Medicare fraud continues to be vigorously prosecuted by the Justice Department, and health care advocates worry that relaxing Medicare regulations could be an incentive for even more fraud.

It seems like some of the existing regulations are blocking attempts to provide people like me and other Medicare participants relief from coping with rising drug prices, incentives to stay healthy and better coordinated care. My question to both sides of this debate is: Why can't we do both - relax or eliminate outdated regulations while at the same time increase Medicare-fraud scrutiny? A real compromise would have those benefiting from deregulation help fund increased Medicare fraud enforcement.

This situation does not have to have one winner. A good compromise could make all of us winners. James Gambone, Orono

HIAWATHA ENCAMPMENT

It's time to reconcile state history that contributes to homeless camp

Your article "Move is cold comfort" (Nov. 25) allows us to hear some of the voices of the mainly American Indian residents of the homeless camp in Minneapolis. We hear about the importance of community, on the one hand, and poverty, mental illness and drug use, on the other. I would ask, what does this tell us about our responsibility as a city and state?

Sadly, the erasure of indigenous history in this country has left most of us blind to the root causes of our problems. I would like to propose a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in light of the Hiawatha encampment. Canada has led the way in this, as well as the Wabanaki People in the state of Maine, as documented in PBS' recent Independent Lens show "Dawnland." The show focuses on the terrible history of residential schools set up to take American Indian children from their families and rob them of their language and culture. We did that here, too, in Minnesota. I believe nothing will change, really, until we come to terms with the truth of what we've done, what happened to the indigenous people and what we must all do to repair it.

SOCIAL SECURITY

Facts to oppose senior tax cut lead to a different answer

Lori Sturdevant makes good points about not exempting state taxes on Social Security ("Math doesn't add up on senior tax cut," Nov. 25). My questions are these: Will the extra money in the state treasury actually be used for the causes she mentions? Is the $353 million added to treasury because of taxing Social Security really that much in a state budget that is in the billions? Can there be cost cutting in other areas?

Senior citizens are living longer. Once retired, many cannot improve their economic outlook. Why do the majority of states not tax Social Security? Shouldn't there be a reward for working hard? I am all for supporting early childhood development and other causes that Sturdevant suggests. My question: Is taking from seniors really the best choice? Are there other areas it can come from?

Hopefully, her assertion that many politicians support no state taxes on Social Security simply to get the senior vote is not true. Hopefully, they support it because they believe it helps seniors have a better financial life leading to a higher quality of life.

Gordon Hayes, St. Paul

Â· Â· Â·

Thank you to Lori Sturdevant for articulating the reasons legislators need to stop the push to eliminate state income taxes on Social Security. Taxpayers with low incomes already receive that benefit and the rest of us need to step up and support the many functions of state governmental agencies. I, for one, have no trouble seeing my tax dollars used to support education, the environment, infrastructure, human services and the many other functions that help make life in Minnesota good for us senior citizens.

POLITICS

Governor's legacy marked by failure to compromise for benefit of state

The Star Tribune missed the mark with its article about Gov. Mark Dayton's legacy ("Dayton's legacy sits with tiny learners," Nov. 25). That legacy has already been written! Dayton will go down as the most partisan governor our state has ever had.

His constant refusal to even inch somewhere close to the middle caused two terms of very ineffective leadership. There were so many opportunities in those two terms where a middle ground would have meant results. Maybe the results would not have been totally what he wanted, but they would have been good for the state and good for the people of Minnesota.

Dayton failed as a senator, and he certainly failed the state of Minnesota. That's his true legacy!

ELECTION 2020

Four more reasons why Klobuchar will win race for presidency

Regarding your article about Sen. Amy Klobuchar being swept up in presidential speculations ("Winning formula for the pivotal Midwest?" Nov. 25). I have thought for months that Amy will be our next president for four reasons:

1. It starts in Iowa. Iowans love the Iowa State Fair, Amy loves state fairs, therefore, Iowans are going to love Amy. She will win Iowa easily and establish herself as the clear front-runner.

2. Other candidates will be moving to the left. Amy will be the leading left-center candidate, where a Democratic candidate needs to be to win the presidency.

3. All things being equal, the Democratic Party wants to nominate a woman.

4. My football coach theory. When a university fires a football coach, it often hires a coach with the opposite personality. After President Donald Trump, Democratic and independent voters will be ready for a no-nonsense, experienced, professional politician with a track record of success. That's Amy Klobuchar!

Jerry Gale, Brooklyn Park

The article had a very sinister photo of Amy Klobuchar. I shared it on Facebook and have been getting complaints. I promised I would take the article down because of the photograph.

FORESTRY

No joking matter: No birch logs will grace this Minneapolis home

I wonder if James Lileks reads the Star Tribune. For years, various articles told us to boycott nurseries, flower shops and hardware stores that sell birch logs or display them because several large areas of woods have been stripped of birch trees for the purpose of profit. Department of Natural Resources employees and private landowners have worked hard to end the practice. This particular article ("Birch log instead of a tree? Fir real?" Nov. 25) is not his usual tongue-in-cheek - this one is too cavalier and thoughtless. Think about it, James.

    <content type="text">Impax Laboratories has asked a California federal judge to again quash investors' attempt to revive claims that the generic drug manufacturer hid news of a federal investigation into whether it was colluding with its competitors to fix the prices of two generic drugs, saying the latest complaint still misses the mark.

The drug company on Thursday maintained that the investors' second amended complaint is long on extra pages but short on new arguments, instead treading water on old ones the court dismissed in September for lacking proof of scienter, or deliberate deceit of the stockholders.

"Plaintiff has fattened up the allegations in support of its central claim that defendants knowingly or recklessly concealed illegal price-fixing by Impax, but the complaint's extra bulk does not cure its core defects," Impax said in its motion to dismiss.

The shareholders initially filed suit in the wake of a November 2016 Bloomberg News report that prosecutors were considering filing criminal charges by the end of that year against several generic drug manufacturers for colluding to fix drug prices.

The report said Impax disclosed it had been subpoenaed by the government as part of this investigation, triggering investors to sell off Impax securities. As a result, the price of the company's stock dropped about 20 percent.

Shareholders then hastened to file what the motion calls "speculative" claims against Impax and its officers, but after months, the investigation turned up no wrongdoing by Impax.

Impax then moved to dismiss the case. The court obliged, finding that the complaint simply claimed the company's senior officials must have known or controlled the price-fixing scheme by virtue of their positions within the company, but failed to show that they actually did.

The investors additionally argued that Impax boasted an inflated profit projection and hid negative sales reports and market shares of diclofenac, a painkiller and the company's largest product by revenue in 2015, and budesonide, used to treat bowel conditions.

But the court found that the company's public statements fell somewhere between fact and optimistic projections â not purposeful deceit or lies.

The court did, however, leave the door open for investors to refile, saying it was possible they could allege a scheme if they could provide specifics on how executives allegedly played an active role in fixing prices.

But nothing in named investor Greg Fleming's second amended complaint makes that leap to show that Impax executives not only had access to pricing information but had actual knowledge of price-fixing, per se, according to the company's Thursday motion.

Impax said the investors have tried to address the court's invitation to fill in the gaps by adding 53 paragraphs' worth of empty accusations concerning Impax executives and their roles at company.

In the end, according to the motion, almost all of the new allegations merely "repeat or rehash" assertions from the previous, dismissed complaint.

Though the second amended complaint cites statements from Impax executives about market conditions and price fluctuations, it all could have just as easily been known to the market as a whole, and none of it establishes a basis for proving the executives knew things and hid them to overinflate the stock, according to the motion.

The revised suit also similarly rehashes claims about the drugs diclofenac and budesonide, according to the motion. The investors allege Impax hid negative sales patterns of diclofenac caused by increased market competition in an attempt to mitigate declining profits on digoxin, which is used to treat heart failure and arrhythmia.

Impax had to stall as long as possible any negative news about earnings, investors alleged, because the company was negotiating the financing for a $580 million purchase of budesonide and other generic drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers Teva and Allergan.

Impax expressed bewilderment that the investors' "implausible" theory as alleged in the prior complaint remains essentially the same in their latest complaint. That theory: that the budesonide acquisition went through despite Impax knowing that prices of the acquired drugs were falling drastically.

The revised complaint's addition of a confidential witness, described as a "senior director of new product planning and portfolio management for branded products at Impax until early 2015," does little to add to the investors' arguments, according to Impax's motion.

At best, the company said, the witness offers generalized and "speculative" observations about meetings executives attended that might have involved pricing.

Representatives for the parties did not respond to requests for comment Friday.

Impax is represented by Peter A. Wald, Marcy C. Priedeman, Morgan E. Whitworth and Christopher Turner of Latham &amp; Watkins LLP.

The investors are represented by Shawn A. Williams, Spencer Burkholz, Luke O. Brooks, Eric I. Niehaus, Angel P. Lau and Jeffrey J. Stein of Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP.

The case is Greg Fleming et al. v. Impax Laboratories Inc., case number 4:16-cv-06557, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

MORNING TAKE

1. Targeting Medicaid Drug Classification

The incoming Senate Finance Committee leaders on Tuesday released a draft bill (S 3702, view bill text) to address Medicaid drug rebate misclassifications that have cost taxpayers billions over the years, signaling a bipartisan approach on an issue that often puts the parties at odds with each other. The measure would give the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services the power to fine drug companies that knowingly misclassify whether a drug is brand-name or generic, which affects how much the government pays for the drug.

Though the Senate plans to consider a nomination at the end of the day, most congressional activity has been deferred. A Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee session reviewing the Food and Drug Administration has been postponed. A House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on the availability of sexual assault forensic evidence kits in hospitals has been rescheduled for Dec. 12.

The House as early as Thursday is expected to quietly pass, by unanimous consent, a stopgap spending extension measure, moving the funding deadline for the seven remaining fiscal 2019 spending bills to Dec. 21. The Senate likely will quickly concur. A health care funding group on Tuesday reminded appropriators of the importance of the remaining measures, even though most health agencies already have received their fiscal 2019 appropriations. Besides the FDA and the Indian Health Service, transportation and housing funding also impact public health.

Medicare Provider Rule

During the final year of the Obama administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a proposed rule seeking to tighten enrollment disclosure requirements for Medicare providers. The agency touted $2.4 billion in estimated savings from improved provider monitoring. The additional effort looks to weed out fraudulent billings and prevent questionable providers from entering the Medicare program. The rules would also provide CMS with more authority to bar providers or suppliers from participating in Medicare.

Comments to CMS from health organizations generally supported the concept of battling fraud but many critiqued the disclosure requirements on provider affiliations and uncollected debts as overly burdensome. On Monday, CMS submitted its final version of the rule to the Office of Management and Budget. The agency, in its periodic regulatory forecasts, estimated publication of the final rule in the first quarter of 2019, but receipt of the rule at OMB could signal an earlier release.

FDA Suggests Process Changes for Device Reviews

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday proposed changes to a review process for new, lower-risk medical devices that it expects more developers to use in coming years. The FDA said the proposed rule on the so-called "de novo" pathway is meant to help developers understand what agency reviewers want to see in an application. The rule package is set to be published on Dec. 7.

    <content type="text">Many people have labeled communism as but a myth: an unattainable fantasy. Jonathan Tepper and Denise Hearn (T&amp;H) have, by contrast, written a new book called â The Myth Of Capitalism: Monopolies And The Death Of Competition â. It contains a series of liberal and conservative critiques of the economic system of the US in particular and the West more generally. 

T&amp;H chronicle the decline of competitiveness in almost every sector of the US economy. Â Most people in the mainstream media are drooling over the record highs being recorded on the stock market, but the book notes, Â âBetween 1996-2016, the number of stocks in the US fell by roughly 50%, from more than 7300 to fewer than 3600, while rising 50% in other developed nations.â Â As T&amp;H painstakingly explain by citing studies and charts, the US economy has been stagnant by most truly relevant metrics since the Reaganomics of the 1980s, such as R&amp;D spending, company longevity, competitive consumer product prices and the number of annual startups. 

The superficiality of the recent Wall Street gains is enabled via trickery such as stock buybacks, oligopolistic mergers &amp; lobbyist-sponsored deregulation and tax exemptions. Â Such corruption used to be illegal, in pre- Reagan and Buckley v. Valeo America. Â Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt both cracked down on monopolies like Standard Oil and the New York Central Railroad by enforcing the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts. Â Every president since Teddy, both Democrat and Republican, cracked down on potential monopolies until Reagan. Â This helped prevent a market crash akin to those of 1907 and 1929, which were the direct result of laissez-faire capitalism. 

Wide-scale mergers started occurring during the Reagan Administration and have only picked up steam ever since.Â Concerning our last president, T&amp;H note that, âObama talked tough on big business and Wall Street, but he raised as much money from them as possible and was arguably even more pro-merger than Bush.Â  His DOJ approved all the airline mergers, creating an oligopoly of four airlinesâ¦ He allowed Googleâs major acquisitions that vertically integrated parts of the ad industryâ¦ The FTC prevented Comcast from buying Time Warner in 2015 and AT&amp;T from acquiring T-Mobile in 2011.Â  These were the only notable mergers Obamaâs DOJ blocked.â 

The book lists all of the industries that have effectively become oligopolies or even monopolies: search engines, beer, beverages, glasses, weapons, banks, telecommunications, social media, cell phone manufacturing, agriculture, airlines, pharmaceuticals, credit rating, tobacco, railroads, etc. The consolidation of market share to a handful of billion-dollar companies has throttled the entry of new companies in our so-called Age of the Startup. T&amp;H write how Facebook has (after buying out Instagram) been able to devastate upstart platform Snapchat by mimicking all of Snapchatâs features. Such treachery, combined with Facebookâs 2B+ user base, ensured Snapchat would end up in the financial spiral thatâs itâs currently in. This is but one example of how the post-merger era has sabotaged fresh competition. The book relays this sobering stat: âIn 1995, the top 100 companies accounted for 53% of all income from publicly traded firms, but by 2015, they captured a whopping 84% of all profits.â After decades of decline, the number of new firm entries fell below the number of firm exits in 2013. This decline in the number of startup innovators inevitably ends up hurting technological innovations. 

The merger bonanza may be great for Wall St, but itâs horrible for Middle America. For instance, T&amp;H write, âWhen workers have fewer employers to choose from in their line of work, their bargaining power disappears.Â  Corporate giants can squeeze their suppliers, but the main thing companies buy is labor, and they have been squeezing workers.â Thus, wages have struggled to keep up with inflation for decades. Benefits are cut, while stock buybacks soar. Unhappy workers in all but 3 states can be shackled to soul-sucking jobs via non-compete clauses. Furthermore, â56% of private sector non-unionized workers are forced into mandatory arbitration and of those, 23% were also denied any access to class-action lawsuits. This means that nearly a quarter of working Americans in the private sector donât have the basic right to sue their employer.â 
  
Mergers arenât good for consumers either, despite what the corporatist rhetoric will tell you. T&amp;H give countless examples of how industries became less innovative after drinking the Oligopoly Kool-Aid. The lack of competition this environment leads to complacency and, thus, a lack of product innovation or even concern for customer service. The book also reports that, âin mergers that led to 6 or fewer significant competitors, prices rose in nearly 95% of casesâ¦ On average, post-merger prices increased 4.3%.â Industries from beer to pharmaceuticals are infamous for fixing prices, due to high barriers of entry for startups and tacit (and sometimes explicit) collusion. According to the bookâs data, the average specialty pharmaceutical medication cost jumped 217% from 2011-2015. Unsurprising, when you consider that, âIn 2017, drug makers paid for 882 lobbyists and spent more than $171.5M in an effort to oppose lower prescription drug prices.â 

Ironically, lobbyists will argue that mergers lead to lower prices and greater innovation. They make the dishonest argument that the goal of the antitrust acts was solely to help consumers. In fact, the legislation never even mentioned consumer efficiency; the bills were all about breaking up the power of the trusts. People like Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson saw how monopolies exceeded government authority in many cases; a lack of government enforcement of industry ultimately led to the Great Depression and the resulting New Deal reformations. 

In the era of the Too-Big-to-Fail banks and corporations, the lessons of âThe Myth Of Capitalismâ are more important than ever. They expose the faÃ§ade of the post-recession âeconomic recoveryâ for what it is: stock buybacks and mergers puffing up the economy. Everyone and everything from workers, consumers, people with medical conditions, startups and the IRS suffer from the corruption of American capitalism. Tepper and Hearn frame their central thesis with liberal ideals and arguments (protecting the consumer, income inequality, maintaining government independence from corporate influence), as well as conservative (market competitiveness, cutting red tape for small business, low consumer prices). A lot is written about the thoughts of Hayek and Friedman, but also leftists like FDR and Marx. The final chapter offers some solutions to the problems of our times, but theyâre pretty predictable if youâve been reading along the whole way. 

Page after page of charts succinctly illustrate the points T&amp;H make about trust-busting, the corrosiveness of the lobbyist class, the benefits of competitive markets, and livings standards for people on Main Street. âThe Myth Of Capitalismâ is a very readable, even-handed and informative primer for anyone questioning whether or not theyâre being gaslighted by the nonstop barrage of praise for the economy by the oligopolistic mainstream media.</content>

    <content type="text">Donât stifle speech

President Trump should come to the realization that he, and he alone, creates the bulk of the news he considers negative. Doesnât it follow, then , that if most news about him from all sources is negative, a search result is going to yield mostly negative news? Maybe he should also come to the realization that most of America does not like him, for myriad reasons. Remember,he lost the popular vote in the election by over 3 million votes. His popularity ratings are pitiful.

Maybe he should also realize that he simply cannot thwart the news or any social media outlet, search engine or feed from exercising its First Amendment rights to publish any information, positive or negative, from a left, center, or right view. That he would even ponder regulating free speech suggests he is a tyrant. Maybe he should realize that he belongs anywhere but in the U.S., where we respect the rights of our media to freely speak for or against the government.

Healthcare facts

The Nov. 24 letter âFacts are factsâ was incorrect with facts regarding Medicare For All saving $2 trillion over 10 years.

The study wasnât sponsored by the Koch brothers. âThe Costs of a National Single-Payer Healthcare Systemâ was published by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The center gets some of its funding from the Koch brothers. The author of the paper cited is Charles Blahous. According to the paper, even doubling all âcurrently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan.â

Blahous wrote, âIt is likely that the actual cost of the (Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plan) would be substantially greater than these estimates, which assume significant administrative and drug cost savings under the plan, and also assume that healthcare providers â¦ will be reimbursed at rates more than 40 percent lower than those currently paid.â

Weâre already seeing thousands of doctors retiring early or changing careers because of the current low reimbursement, and premiums continue to rise. To what country do the ill come for the best medical care in the world? Why do Canadians come south when they canât wait four to six months for urgent medical care?

It would be hard to name one Federal program that hasnât ended up costing extremely more than promised. I and millions of Americans are still waiting for that $2,500 annual savings of Obamacare and âyou can keep your doctorâ and âkeep your (insurance) plan.â

Christmas thoughts

Well, I just sold my trusty 1997 Grand Am Pontiac for a grand total of $300. Now that Iâm 91, I donât drive badly. Itâs just that we elderly are the only ones with the time to do the speed limit.

91! Did you know that birthdays are good for you? People who have the most live the longest. I was always taught to respect my elders, but now Iâve reached the age when I donât have anybody to respect.

My neighbor asked me why I was so glum the other day and I told her I was just thinking about getting older and all the people Iâve lost along the way. And she said, âWell, Doris, maybe a career as a tour host wasnât for you.â

No wonder that the twinkle in my eyes is just the sun hitting my bifocals. Oh well, my back goes out more often than I do. When I stand or sit and stand again to sing hymns at church, I groan âoh, Godâ so often that the lady sitting in front of me asked if I graduated from a nunnery.

People my age get all confused trying to remember the simplest of things. Anyway ... happy Easter.

Climate assessment flawed

The Federal Government has released their most recent National Climate Assessment report. And the media is promoting the predictions made by the report for 30 to 80 years in the future. But climate models are extremely complex and have been prone to prediction errors. Claims based on these models have damaged their credibility. Just ask Al Gore, who said in 2007 that Artic ice could be completely gone in the summer by 2014.

One thing is sure: The U.S. canât stop or even significantly slow the rise in global CO2 emissions. The U.S. has reduced CO2 emissions more than the European Union or any country in the world. And the U.S. will continue reductions as economics dictate converting power plants from coal to natural gas. But in 2017, the world added 10 tons of CO2 for every ton of CO2 the U.S. reduced. It seems countries are trying to bail a sinking ship with a teacup.

Rejoining the Paris Accord isnât the answer. The two fastest growing CO2 emitters, India and China, are part of the Paris Accord but have no obligations to reduce CO2 emissions until after 2030. China and India represented 50 percent of the increase in global CO2 emissions in 2017. They and other so-called developing countries will continue to increase global CO2 emissions because they will continue to develop.

If CO2 emissions are causing âclimate changeâ and we canât stop or reduce them, then we should make preparations to deal with the expected âclimate changeâ effects.

Tale of 2 presidents

This past week has afforded us the contrast of opposites in that limited list of individuals to hold the office of President of the United States.

One is being remembered for his distinguished courage, while the other claims military patriotism while having managed to never serve due to student deferments and âbone spurs.â

One was dignified, honest and principled, while the other is boastful, untruthful and disrespectful.

One is being honored for his humility, civility and resolute experience, while the other is narcissistic, insensitive and insulting.

One was responsible for the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Clean Air Act, while the other has publicly made fun of disabled individuals, gutted the Environmental Protection Agency through senseless deregulation, deferring to the greed of industry, and is the climate change denier in chief.

Former President George H.W. Bush was laid to rest this week, warmly and deservedly honored by Democrats and Republicans alike.President Donald J. Trump continues to put the interests of America aside, in deference to some of the worldâs most despicable abusers of human rights.

Both Republicans and Democrats have voiced their recognition of this, also.

    <content type="text">Novo Nordisk A/S is fashioning its R&amp;D makeover to integrate artificial intelligence across its drug discovery and development process, after a pilot program delivered the cost and time savings the pharma was looking for. 

In 2019, Novo will redirect the budget for new lab space and equipment into computers and software. It will also trim its R&amp;D workforce by 400 heads, primarily by slimming down its medicinal chemistry teams. It will retain chemists who work in data science. 

According to EVP and CSO Mads Thomsen, the budget redirect involves about DKK400-DKK500 million ($60.4-$75.5 million) -- about 3% of total R&amp;D spending. The workforce reduction is about 1% of the total employee base. Novo would not disclose its R&amp;D headcount. 

Novo follows Pfizer Inc., AstraZeneca plc and Novartis AG in adopting AI-guided drug design, with the goal of improving efficiency. Numerous other pharmas are evaluating the use of AI-assisted drug discovery through partnerships, the most recent being a Dec. 6 deal between Merck KGaA and Cyclica Inc. 

Based on its pilot, Novo thinks it can cut in half the time and cost of drug discovery and lead optimization. It also expects the software tools to improve selection of patient populations for clinical trials compared with traditional methods. 

This is the latest in a series of moves that Novo has made over the last two years to remake its R&amp;D in the face of growing downward pricing pressures on its diabetes franchise. The pharma has already culled its pipeline of molecules that only provide an incremental benefit, and is focusing exclusively on programs that substantially improve outcomes for patients and payers in a range of therapeutic areas beyond its historical remit of diabetes (see âMountain Climbingâ ). 

The most recent threat to Novoâs diabetes franchise came in October, when Eli Lilly and Co. reported Phase IIb data from its dual gastric inhibitory protein (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist LY3298176, showing it could compete with Novoâs once-weekly GLP-1 analog Ozempic semaglutide. 

Thomsen told BioCentury Novo believes it has the development strategies and molecules in place to retain Ozempicâs position as a best-in-class therapy for Type II diabetes and obesity. On Nov. 23, Novo announced plans to submit regulatory applications in Europe and the U.S. next year for what would be the first oral formulation of a GLP-1 agent. 

Thomsen is giving the R&amp;D teams a mandate to explore a broader range of therapeutic areas and modalities than the peptides and proteins for diabetes that have been its staples. 

In addition, Novo is creating four semi-autonomous translational units tasked with developing new technologies for new indications (see âSidebar: TRU Innovationâ).

    <content type="text">Issues like budgets and funding for education are staples of every legislative session in every state. In the second installment of our annual three-part legislative preview (see part 1), we continue to look at other issues we think will keep lawmakers occupied in the coming year.

Health Care

Although the hue and cry heading into Novemberâs midterm elections was often centered on other issues, voters were most concerned with health care.[1] As reporter Annie Lowrey wrote in The Atlantic[2] a few days before the election, âHealth care has become the single most important policy topic in the midterm elections â everywhere and nowhere, a strange kind of omnipresent sleeper issue. Itâs not grabbing many national headlines, compared with the migrant caravan or the Supreme Court fight or violence directed against minority groups or the trade war, but itâs motivating voters in race after race after race.â

That isnât likely to abate in the coming year, even though Democrats reclaiming the House likely will prevent congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump from completely overturning the Affordable Care Act. But any number of federal rules around issues like insurer subsidies and approving state-level plans definitely remain in play, including for those that violate tenets of the ACA.[3]

The end of the federal mandate for individuals to have health coverage or pay a penalty will also be part of the discussion. With several states already reporting a decline in ACA enrollment, there is growing concern among health advocates that the uninsured will again be flooding into emergency rooms, long the most expensive and least efficient medical care available. With virtually no chance that Congress will reinstate the mandate, some states will at least consider copying New Jersey by imposing their own mandate.[4]

Medicaid

Of the seven governorships that are moving from GOP to Dem control, all seven Democrats ran on a platform of expanding Medicaid or retaining expansion already undertaken in their states. Voters also endorsed ballot measures to authorize expansion in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah, bringing to 36 the number of states agreeing to broaden Medicaid eligibility to include those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Attention will focus primarily on Kansas and Wisconsin, two of the states with incoming Democratic governors that support expansion but which face GOP-controlled legislatures where support for it ranges from uncertain to unlikely.

Bird's-Eye View

Almost Three Quarters of States Have Now Expanded Medicaid


Voters in three states approved measures on Election Night to expand Medicaid, bringing to 36 (plus the District of Columbia) the number that have agreed to broaden eligibility to include those earning 138 percent of the federal poverty rate. One of those, Maine, approved expansion in 2017 but the process has been repeatedly blocked by Republican Gov. Paul LePage. That is expected to change in January when Democratic Gov.-elect Janet MillsÂ takes office. Conversely, Montana voters in November rejected a ballot measure that would have extended the Treasure Stateâs expansion beyond June 30, 2019. That plan will sunset on that date unless lawmakers extend it.

Drug Prices

States have made a number of efforts in recent years[5] to control rising prescription drug prices, including bills to address pharmaceutical price-gouging, removing so-called âgag ordersâ on pharmacy benefit managers and requiring greater transparency from drug companies seeking price hikes. With federal action on drug pricing bogged down[6], expect states to continue looking at numerous angles for controlling price increases.

Net Neutrality

Net neutrality â barring telecoms and ISP providers from blocking or slowing down access to websites or other internet services and content to coerce consumers into paying for their services instead â became a highly contentious issue in a majority of statehouses in 2018. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 30 states introduced[7] a total of 72 bills this year addressing net neutrality, with three adopting net neutrality requirements. A fourth, Californiaâs SB 822, would enact even tougher net neutrality requirements than those the Federal Communications Commission dropped earlier this year.[8]

The wild card is pending litigation before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which is expected to rule in the spring on a lawsuit brought forth by 22 state attorneys general, consumer groups and even some tech companies seeking to overturn the FCC action. There are also two pending lawsuits seeking to overturn the California law, one by a collection of telecoms and the other by the Trump administration. California reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to hold off implementing its law until the court rules.

If the court ultimately restores net neutrality, state laws would essentially become moot. If not, or if the case continues on to a possible Supreme Court challenge, another wave of state-level legislation, particularly in states that turned blue on Election Day, could be forthcoming.[9]

Gerrymandering

With centennial redistricting drawing near and partisanship at a fever pitch, the interest in who will draw state and congressional district lines is intense. As reported in the State Net Capitol Journal last month[10], at least 19 states this year considered bills to have those lines drawn by independent commissions rather than by lawmakers, while voters in four states approved measures in November to adopt commissions. Meanwhile, legal battles continue over how the lines in Maryland, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Texas and Virginia are drawn. Another is likely to be filed in New Jersey if majority Democrats there go forth with a plan to change the Garden State constitution to entrench their hold on Trenton.[11] Meanwhile, eyes will be on Missouri, where voters approved a measure that creates a first-in-the-nation system[12] using a mathematical formula to ensure fairness in how its lines are drawn.

Sports Betting

In the months since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting, a half dozen states have gone all in on the opportunity to score big off the nationâs passion for wagering on sports. If the fiscal windfall in states like New Jersey[13] is any indication of the money to be made, it shouldnât be surprising that a whole lot more are looking to join them in 2019.[14] But doing so requires answering some potentially thorny questions, such as how much each state will tax sports wagers, both in person and online, and what kind of licensing fees states will charge to sportsbook operators. There is also the growing push from professional sports leagues to get their cut in the form of so-called âintegrity feesâ they say will cover their increased cost of ensuring the games stay above board.

Opioids

In recent years states have undertaken a wide range of efforts to curb opioid abuse, including weighing in on at least 480 opioid-related bills across 45 states in 2018.[15] But in spite of many states providing greater access to the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, limiting how doctors may prescribe opioid pain medications and significantly enhanced monitoring of drug prescriptions, opioid-related deaths continue to rise. With no end in sight, there will undoubtedly continue to be a staggering number of bills introduced in this area. One interesting possibility to keep an eye on is the use of cannabis for pain relief instead of opioid medications. Although the supporting data is limited, states like Illinois[16] and Georgia are now openly promoting marijuana as an alternative to opioids.

Paid Sick Leave

Less than a dozen states currently have laws requiring employers to offer workers specific amounts of paid sick leave, something that has driven the issue more to the local level than to statewide applications. That could well change with Democrats taking control of all branches of government in several states next year. But opponents of such laws are also gearing up for a fight. In Michigan, the GOP-controlled legislature this month made sweeping changes[17] to paid sick leave and minimum wage laws adopted last September as a means for keeping them off the ballot. And in Texas, a recent appeals court ruling[18] invalidated a paid sick leave ordinance adopted in Austin last February. The ruling was specific to that city, but observers expect it will spark a challenge to a similar ordinance in San Antonio, and legislation has already been filed in the statehouse[19] to bar local jurisdictions from adopting their own paid sick leave laws.

Disaster Liability

A battle is shaping up in fire-ravaged California over not only how to better protect against massive wildfires but also the liability of public utilities like Pacific Gas &amp; Electric for its role in how many of those fires started. Similar debates could strike up all over the western U.S., as assuredly will those revolving around efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change.
